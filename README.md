# Twitterbot_Collection_Code
This code was created in order to evaluate how successful known Russian twitter bots were at influencing people. The list of Russian bots was obtained from a list released by Congress (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731). In addition to my own code I used a twitter crawler (https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python) that I slightly modified to help with the tweet collection process.

# What did I do with my code?
1) Verified the Russian bots were banned by atempting to collect their tweets
2) Collected the usernames of people who replied to, hashtaged or mentioned the username of a Russian bot
3) Collected all of the tweets of the users found in step 2 between 01/01/16 and 11/04/17
4) Found usernames of people who had not interacted with the Russian bots for a control group 
5) Colleced all of the tweets of the users found in step 4 between 01/01/16 and 11/04/17
