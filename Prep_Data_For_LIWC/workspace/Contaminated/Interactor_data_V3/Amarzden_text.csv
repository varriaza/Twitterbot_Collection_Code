"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet Counter productive for u to deflect criticism when there are rapes etc. Response to criticism more than rapes."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet You don't know them personally, but they do exist by the millions in the 3rd world, which is coming to you now"
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet Sure, but again not relevant to these events. Giant Muslim rape gangs all over Europe are a pressing concern."

"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet Re 1st: I never said otherwise. 2nd depends on which Muslim you talk to."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet Think abt the ROOT CAUSE behind massive organized rape gangs - it is Muslim rape culture - no hate, just facts"
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet True statements are not slurs. Muslim culture is based on Sharia law - many support it - condones rape, etc."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet Sends a message to Muslim immigrants "you are above the law", that's the real, concrete danger."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet These rapes & assaults were allowed to happen BECAUSE ppl are afraid to speak truthfully abt Muslim immigrants"
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet U claim criticizing Muslim rape cultures & Muslim rapists puts Muslim kids in danger?? Opposite is true."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet Nope, the two are not connected, those kids are not put in danger from the truth."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet u seem to think we can't condemn these ppl without forgetting other criminals exist. False notion."
"@andyrossecon @OrderOfTheNeet u keep claiming that talking about Muslim immigrant rapists involves spreading hate.No idea wht ur talking abt"
