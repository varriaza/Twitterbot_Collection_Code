"Oh, sorry. That was me. I just wanted access to that cacti video. I'll stop."
"Believe as many things that are true, and as few things that are false, as I can. It means understanding the difference."
"Well, yeah. Those are places where Catholic missionaries are preaching against condom use and abortion. Proselytizing their bullshit."
"And what makes you think that's not exactly what those clergy thought they were doing?? You simply don't understand how faith works. Your pic.twitter.com/7TbSPdk7BQ"
"HAH!! Fair enough."
"Well, I don't know about "open arms". Personally, I'll be keeping him at arm's length."
"LOL. Hocus pokus. You don't even understand what that means, much less why he was called "Son of Man". There were many before him."
"Err nah."
"HAH!! Cacti have anuses?? Show us video, or it ain't real."
"Well, Japan isn't really a fair comparison. People are killed by sword-wielding ninjas in Japan. Nobody needs a gun."
"Oh, of course not. We should be laughing in their faces as we point out how ridiculous their claims are. pic.twitter.com/IE2kGxr5cW"
"You don't know "what Jesus would do". You think you know more than all the clergy who condemned Giordono Bruno knew? You're an arrogant ass."
"I'm a centrist, myself. I can't stand the progressive movement, and fundy conservative Christians give me the willies."
"Actually, I think the zeitgeist is changing a helluva lot faster than we had a reasonable expectation it would 20 yrs ago. Shouldn't be long"
"Well, it isn't necessary, logically. Also, think about what the Universe is constantly expanding into. Can't be "nothing", right?"
"Yeah, that wasn't what I said. I said believing in resurrections, magic births, flood myths, et al, w/o evidence is insanity. There's a big pic.twitter.com/CJKLYplvwb"
"No, just belief in the somethings that religions claim without evidence is insanity. Like resurrections, healing by laying on hands, etc."
"Or who, and what, 2 Peter was trying to refute by claiming "We don't follow cleverly devised myths" and then making up eyewitness accounts."
"Yeah, too bad that the only evidence we've found after 2000 years points to the vast majority of bible claims being false."
"Bullshit. That's an oft misused, highly situational axiom. There are far more cases where that isn't true. Especially as concerns faith."
