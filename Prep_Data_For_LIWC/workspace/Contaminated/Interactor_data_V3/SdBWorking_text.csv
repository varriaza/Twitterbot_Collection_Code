"No. It’s you."
"Today I hate people. I can’t wait to focus all my anger on a murdery husband!!! @DatelineNBC @JoshMankiewicz and a gf BUNDT!"
"I just can’t. My uncle owns a pretty well known deli up by me and I grew up with my half Jewish family. Just can’t get behind tongue!"
"Sigh."
"He’s hardly desperate. Just because you’re loud doesn’t mean your voice matters. You know what went down. Come on."
"Why are you sorry about that? I’m certainly not. I’d love to give him back."
"Mmmmmmmmm! Thanks!!!!!"
"it’s not too soon to say that the kid on @YoungSheldon is going to be a HUUUUUUUGE STAR!!! And the mom is so much like Sheldon mom on TBB!"
"Why does she always look high and greasy?"
"Hmmmmm. Wonder who witnessed and said nothing."
"As are ALL truly great love songs!!!"
"I’m going to vomit."
"Yes, those are the ones. Siiiiiiigh. Yes. Yeeeeeeees."
"Treatment, you say? For what, EXACTLY? What modality? For how long? With what PURPOSE? SHAM."
"I hope she gets smacked around a little, the stupid, awful, white trash barbie."
"So. Many. Confusing. Feelings."
"I’ve been on for ten years. BRUTAL."
"I saw pic of you after mask. If that’s you sans fard, I think way more articles need to be written about you. You’re flawless."
"@LanceBass"
"I don’t think anyone actually grows up in Florida. Based on actions such as these, anyway."
"I’m sure that’s just the tip...of the iceberg."
"What are your thoughts about them keeping Masterson series?."
"It’s like Willy Wonka, “scratch that. Reverse it””!”"
"Those scumbag thugs should have gotten felony time at the same time. Why should their family be considered more than any other thug’s?"
"I’m NOT a fan but he should get out. For Pete’s sake, those scumbag Jacksons STOLE FROM TAXPAYERS and got little punishment. Obscene!"
"Although frenching a cow wd be the most action I’ve had in a while..."
"I’m never dismayed by our opposing political views bc ur awesome. However, THIS one is killing me a little inside-and my uncle owns a deli!"
"Hopefully, soon to be a pile of ashes buried in an unmarked grave."
"I just want to know the dog is ok."
"Leave it on and at home. Lol."
"Harvey has a shot, possibly, but Spacey is likely who he’s going to remain if he was into kids. That doesn’t go away. This is awful."
"I know what you are saying. Completely agree. I’m just annoyed that it’s presented as a place you go to get fixed in three months. It’s not!"
"Therapy, sure. Absolutely. But going into treatment is a smoke screen."
"I’m assuming she has been expelled as well as anyone who knew and said nothing, which is equally abhorrent."
"Pretty sure you could just randomly arrest this guy and SOMETHING is going to be a felony."
"You were awesome. Looks like you found a plan B should you ever want one!!!"
"That would be GREAT!"
"That makes me so sad."
"It never says WHAT they are treating exactly and HOW. COME ON!!!"
"I love everything you do. Please, never leave us."
"How does that fall within professional ethical guidelines? Seriously!!!"
"Every single one of them should meet the families of the men he murdered then see if they get up there and extol his virtue."
"But otherwise, she shows SUCH incredible judgment. At least PRISON didn’t make her hard. Lol."
"Lol. Coming from a true sociopath, that’s hilarious."
"She must be in great shape. I would have had a stroke!"
"The officer should have aimed just a bit higher. I’m grateful, of course, but just a bit higher."
"He lightens up a dark time."
"For what? Seriously, I want to know what is being treated. So far, he just says he’s gay. Can’t treat that. Soooo? Say what he is in tx for!"
"I have GOT to stop trying new shows. Right, @CBS ?"
"That’s actually a great question. Can anyone ever say anything mean to that face? I can’t imagine it."
"Just one? That’s not gonna keep you thru first commercial break!!"
"They know they couldn’t meet the demand. Right, @NBC ? Sigh."
"Helluva fight @Dodgers You had serious heart! And this is from a CUBS fan!"
"I support mommy getting it in her butt for $. She used it to get a pole installed in my room. I’m gonna be a strong business woman soon too!"
"That is truly sad and sooooo sick. They should have fired her the minute they heard her speak to her parents. They’re a sick bunch."
"I’m literally NOBODY and I got creeper vibes from this guy. Shudder."
"Woohoo!!!!!"
"Omg. Lol. Ok."
"No. Just nope. Uh-uh. No."
"PIE IS ALL TOO REAL!!!"
"Well, Donald is the one who walked around without pants..."

"Omg. Scary. I’m so glad she’s ok!"
"Wasn’t she a Hooker? Leave her alone. She will never have enough. Spotlight makes it worse. She’s empty. Don’t pile on."
"Scientology auditing is no substitute for anything."
"Oh are you a Scientologist?"
"Can we all check in there and take a “maid” with us when we leave?"
"Wow! Fantastic!"
"I agree with teaching her to willingly share but having it taken from her is way different!!!"
"Something has to be up with that right? Where is Julio really? What’s going on for real?"
"Is Sharon ok?"
"Um @JoshMankiewicz I’m thinking we’ve reached max capacity Florida now. https:// twitter.com/news6wkmg/stat us/925505459414450176 …"

"I’m ready but not ready. I’m freaking OUT about it ending. I’ll never be ready. I’m FREAKING. OUT."
"Now you’ve done it. Brace yourself for the backlash."
"I’m not sure what I’m not getting. I find this very confusing and my moral compass is just spinning out of control."
"Damn, Florida!"
"Gross."
"I’d think there would be many more Harvey Weinsteins complaining right now."
"Well, ppl are stupid."
"I think it’s just “amid” and not “due to,” correct?"
"If she is supporting theft, forced abortion, brainwashing, family destruction, isolation, brutality, her view is clear. And scary. SCARY!"
"Ok. 2500 pics and videos. Two counts? Only prosecuting two counts? What? How is that possible? What is that? An hour and a half in prison?"
"I don’t care about him. I don’t want to pay for his care. He should get the chair."
"Vomit. I just can’t even read this. I can’t."
"lol. Nah. Gotta go where the food is the only thing I can tell if it’s cold."
"The only ppl talking about this are her and the photographer. It’s over. She’s over. It’s ok."
"I would have been so easy to kidnap. Wave a KitKat at me and I’ll follow you into a fire."
"And I do."
"So, are we headed to bennigan’s or what? Lol."
"Can anyone deny having at least one nightmare in which Kevin spacey is prominently featured? We all have. Deep down, we knew. We knew."
"I’ll go just to see if she’s a zombie. If so, that makeup artist is a LOCK for an Oscar. How can you undead her luminous, perfect skin?"
"@MajorCrimesTNT sigh. I want it to come back. But not yet. The sooner it does, the sooner it’s over. I’m so sad. Excited and sad. It’s weird"
"The world is circling the drain. I do not get it. I thought this was the one last unifying thing we could all share. I’m saddened."
"I’ve never had flavored ones. The monster ones don’t taste like I’d imagine monsters to taste thank goodness."
"I’ve seen you in our @Dateline chats."
"You mean, like, with a cloth? Probably."
"I hope he has a huge comeback!!!"
"That is one GORGEOUS child. She should go as herself. I have a feeling she’d get tons more candy. Oh that sweet face!!!"
"Well if you’re gonna go, go smiling. Or grimacing I guess. Oh yeah. It’s pre-porn."
"Monster peeps. Omg MONSTER PEEPS! Sorry. I don’t get how anyone can resist. It’s like eating a squishy monster. Who doesn’t want to do that?"
"Stop! Seriously? Nooooo. Really?"
"She’s losing it."
"Orrrr ONION RINGS!!!!!!"
"P’shaw! She has all the signs of a SharkDolphin Dolphinshark!"
"With extra cheese please!!! :)"
"Well, to be fair, he is carrying a sword. Good puppies."
"They can’t make the accuser look so sweet and innocent and vulnerable if they think all men are predators who should pay. Lol. Conundrum."
"He can’t even look at her. It’s sad really. I bet the only reason he hasn’t hit her is bc she could whomp him!"
"It’s crazy to see all these inept people trying to find love in a different culture bc they think they’ll be accepted and not have to change"
"Everyone knows he’s gay. It’s not news. Him assaulting a kid is news. Him being drunk is also not news. Sigh."
"She’s a child. I think their relationship is creepy. She is acting her age and it’s disturbing."
"I hope it’s dismantled soon. It’s so criminal it’s scary."
"That’s GREAT!"
"I get it. When I see most rappers, I lose my stomach."

"Chicago calling @JoshMankiewicz !!!! https:// twitter.com/chicagomag/sta tus/925053438454648837 …"
"@DatelineNBC @JoshMankiewicz why don’t you just set up satellite studio in Florida!!!! I’d work there!!! Wait. I’d never get time off in Fla"
"Good point. Then he should just ask others in the situation to stand up and he will back them up. Otherwise he’s kinda pointless."
"Which is why she’d do it. She lives for the spotlight. Free lawyering."
"Why?"
"With everything going on, Gloria Allred never turns down the spotlight. Get her. She will FIND a way to make it profitable!"
"He can report to authorities with no lawyer."
"Who on earth didn’t know Spacey was gay? He was deflecting not excusing. Predators are not about orientation. They’re about abuse and power."
"Everyone is out there throwing around names right now. He can just tell cops. FBI. Anyone. He’s being ridiculous."
"Why vow to name names? Just do it. Quit talking about it. Save some kids for Pete’s sake."
"IT DIDNT HAPPEN! Oh wait no. IM GAY! Oh that’s not helpful. I DONT REMEMBER! Not buying it. I WAS DRUNK! That’ll work. To do: announce rehab"
"Very confusing. He came out as a pedophile? Everyone already knew he was gay. Do pedophiles need to come out or just get arrested?"
"It’s weird that she’s the older one with her insecurities and baby voice. Ugh."
"He is SOOOOOO CREEPY!!!!! Production should stop it before it goes too far."
"Wait. How is that possible?"
"https://www. facebook.com/rankerweirdhis tory/posts/947105132112529 …"
"Even though you were not nice to my nephew and his friends, I still, and always will, just love you!!! Happy Wintering! Stay warm and SAFE!"
"And? Her poor mental and emotional state are NOT news. Leave her alone. She has enough problems. no spotlight needed."
"I want to go to there."
"Oh my gosh."
"Thank you for doing a difficult but important job!"
"Why didn’t aunt keep the kids? Do they see the sister?"
"Right back atcha!"
"She wouldn’t have bled into her costume like that then. He’s a real sicko."
"You can’t have a broken face, so much blood, torn costume, no anonymous tip. MURDERER! Can’t wait to see his new costume. Orange jumpsuit!"
"He saw her drunk. Talk her into the fresh air, punched her to get her into the car. Kept punching. Took to gross place where it all happened"
"How does she even know about it?"
"Why do people have sex without birth control?"
"If I go out I’m wearing REAL poison ivy. @DatelineNBC"
"They’re allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia."
"They had to find this homeless scumbag in random trailer. Crazy."
"Why make them O anyway? It’s not like that’s how you know it’s over. You can’t be effing a robot and have any kind of moral code."
"Gross gross gross guy. Gross. Who would sleep with this loser? @DatelineNBC"
"I was lost without a husband to blame then possibly clear. Ugh."
"Gross kid. @DatelineNBC"

"The Chicago Judge : 10!!!"
"Oh. One of those beer hats?"
"We LOVE this show and everyone on or associated with it. LOVE!"
"Hmmnmmmm just in case. @DatelineNBC yes."
"Oh you don’t have an IV? Makes it easier to type."
"Just leave you kit on the counter. The ziplocks of hair with root, saliva, current picture, cheek swab etc... for both of you."
"Taco"
"Ohhhhh we never miss it!"
"Omg me too!!!"
"Shhhhhhhh"
"He’d take others down with him from all the gagging."
"No!!! Ew. It had to be sweaty, smell like sweat, cheap beer, dirt and pee. Nope."
"Another hot detective. Omg is it just me? @DatelineNBC"
"He’d die of dehydration from all the crying."
"You don’t need one. Just moon walk out of the interrogation."
"If hes interrogated and his eyeliner runs, he gets the chair guilty or not."
"Ummmmmmm. I would have."
"Please. That’s not even enough for an amuse bouche."
"Maybe it was windy and his hair got caught in a combine. That’s what’s left."
"Unpopular? Amongst whom? I’m all about avoiding fecal matter, so NO to the big ole poop patches on someone’s face."

"Maybe but it’s not required and he has the right to say what he wants."
"I think we all will. When we watch their episode in the not too distant future, I fear."
"You MADE ME ADD!!!"
"I could never enforce those. I hate awkward silences. As u can see, I always have to fill the void."
"Ok. You’re back!!! :)"
"Plus, I think there are still laws on the books about not taking compliments when you have bone structure like that. So be careful."
"(Sidebar: I can’t tell someone to not feel a way. All I can do is let you know you’re very wrong bc you’re gorgeous. Lol! Now shhhh!)"
"Shhhhh."
"I just added one."
"Shhhh. Or I’ll add minutes."
"You should start to exploit her now, while she’s not wise to it."
"How many years has she been in sixth grade for Pete’s sake? WOW!!!"
"Don’t talk to me. You’re in time out."
"You’re not allowed to have all that swag, have a gorgeous dog and also BE gorgeous. That’s pretty unfair. Then you flaunt it. Nope. I’m mad!"
"I’m all kinds of loving this picture. I’m also mad at you. In a jealous way bc I’m a horrible jealous person. Sigh."
"I’m totally on his side about making choices that he wants to make. It means nothing if he can’t address everything going on! It’s too much!"
"Hey, can’t stand the guy and quit watching but he’s a talk show host. He chooses his topics. That’s quite ok. He’s allowed to let some pass!"
"Isn’t this episode like a baseline for all episodes? It had everything. Except a mime. I know I know, we had chair sex and a bald Folsom. Ok"
"Huh. I’m like a very frayed string theory. Or maybe more like Schroedingers cat, but like, just the dead one."
"Ok. No. Have you even SEEN Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell? They’re walking hormones when together. It’s gross and adorable. Perfect."
"Sorry I went on and on but I’m still all revved up from this one @DatelineNBC it was killer, so to speak. I forgot to eat my brownies!!!"
"The only thing missing was a mime."
"Crazy fast verdict. Keith’s “wellll, you’ve loved a LOT of women!” Then the appeal presented at sentencing bc its French. Seriously."
"Profitable foot fetish, sandals in crime scene. Patty Stanger friend. Extra baby. Prison Folsom. 40 felonies. Pointless good club. Sequins."
"Named Gardener. Selfie kids with crazy first year pool party. Special gambling buddy with 80 cars. Dog-hating father in law. Big Ange."
"This was a top five. For sure! Let’s run it down, shall we? French lady with bad taste and missing her “H”s. Dateline-watching handyman"
"She can’t. She’s stuck to the side. Poor thing."
"She looked like that giant goldfish everyone has in their dentist waiting room."
"It was a top five. For sure."
"I bet she did that AFTER the murder so it wouldn’t happen to her. Her face CAN’T go under."
"I hope not. Have you ever seen a balloon blown up to capacity then deflated? Like a rubber raisin. No."
"You loved a LOT of women. Lol. Oh @dateline_keith"
"Is there such a motherfucker out there?"
"Alvin?"
"It’s FLORIDA. That’s also why no blood settled. No room. All fillers and Botox."
"There is a tiny part of me that admired his commitment to being a criminal. Successful."
"Is it Alvin? Please let it be Alvin. @DatelineNBC @DatelineNBC"
"Botox. Have you SEEN the ladies in this episode? It’s Florida! They even Botox up their earlobes."
"Botox!!!"
"Not me! I then shore up my vote. It’s good to break a little then build up stronger!!! Lol"
"No wrinkling. Ummm Botox. Did you SEE her and her friends? @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"That’s why they said to shampoo rinse repeat."
"His face is just doughy from drink, gambling, strippers, general scumbaggery. He will always look guilty about something."
"We decided he is in prison for crimes against attitude."
"No raisins ever-dead wet person fingertips cut off then put on coroner to print. When taken off they SPRSH on the metal. Black like raisins!"
"My thoughts exactly."
"fave episode ever. a bald white snitchy Folsom. Bunions. Big Ange. Strippers. Dog. Chair sex. Kid selfie site. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"Don’t forget, it’s @DatelineNBC and it’s the husband. I watch bc I’m single. I hope it’s him. Or stupid, dog-hating, Alvin."
"Think of all the millions of Medicare bunions in Florida. Think about it. It’s possible."
"That’s actually true. They’re really just fluids and sharp edges."
"DAAAAAAANG."
"I suggest bath oils."
"True. True. Sorry. Hands up, backing off."
"Lolololol."
"But it IS florida. Remember, lots of grays so bunions galore!!!!"
"How many ingrown toenails does it take to finally snap?!?!"
"It’s Florida. Oranges, dolphins. Cmon girl get your head in the game."
"Knew it."
"Shaquita does not sound like a stage name unless they put a pole in Walmart. I think it’s a kind of dolphin, actually."
"I leap to the end of the green mile dragging the cheating lying husbands behind me to the chair."
"I don’t trust ppl who sleep with strippers when they’re married. It rubs me the wrong way."
"I think Adam showers a bit more."
"She won’t notice. She can’t see past her lips."
"They always think to call the dead person phone. Ugh. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"Are you kidding? Who slithers better than a stripper?"
"I’m feeling some Martha. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC and still some Alvin."
"@dateline_keith @DatelineNBC if the mother of his kids got killed by his whores, sorry. Still needs to get the chair. Ew. Pig."
"Omg were you up the river? Are you on the lam?"
"CELEBRATION. ALWAYS! Bring brownies!!!"
"Shoot. I was JUST saying none of us will give up our DNA without a warrant."
"@DatelineNBCProd you gotta tell ancestry no one watching is giving their DNA to anyone without a warrant. Come on. Amateurs we are NOT!"
"As long as it’s him uncomfortable who cares. All she had to do was hold on for dear life."
"Oh it is totally possible."
"Adam looks like a bad guy in Law & Order. @DatelineNBC @dateline_keith"
"Uh yeah."
"@dateline_keith @DatelineNBC goodness it is really crazy how gorgeous that kid is. Doesn’t make me want one. Even the cute ones have fluids."
"No. You blame the way they changed once you got married."
"You gotta ask. I was just saying, I would have meant brownies."
"Lol. We are here to fill you in. Just ask. We r ur friends! Weze family up in here."
"If you offer a scenario, I don’t like it. Stop talking. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC at least cry. Sheesh."
"The Patty Stanger Big Ange one?"
"You never know. I would mean brownies."
"Chair sex? No tears? Feet for money? Sandal in pool? Gambling? Didn’t ask about his dog? GUILTY! @DatelineNBC @dateline_keith"
"You need a Skype buddy. Are you new? Lol."
"That was before @DatelineNBC I mean, an entire focus on FEET? Not normal to begin with. No. It’s a fetish that paid off."
"When your house looks like that and that is how you throw a baby party, yeah. Something stinks like bad feet!!!"
"Something fishy and tasteless."
"More like Flavorless. Yuck."
"I smell possible fraud. Addiction? @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"@dateline_keith @DatelineNBC ok. No. Money on my clean bed? I DONT CARE HOW MUCH IT WAS. THAT. IS. FILTHY."
"Ew and I hope we never have to. Shudder."
"We always want to know about the pets. Tell the others!"
"Thank you. I can finally exhale."
"I don’t high five but HIGHFIVE!!!"
"Oh. Can they make eggs and a uterus though? Wait. It’s France. I bet they can-can."
"A Florida Donna Summer. I forgot to specify. Thought it went without saying."
"Into what? Death? Yeah. I’d say that was pretty successful."
"Plus, Alvin hates the dog so I think it was him. Plus WHERE IS THE FRICKING DOG? @DatelineNBCProd not saying."
"Looked like Donna Summer without her “H”s."
"Ohhhh. Good point. I still want it to be Alvin. Stupid dog-hating Alvin."
"Shady. Weird. I no like. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"Ok. This is weird. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC I feel weird about these guys. I no like."
"I hope it was Alvin. I’m not a fan."
"Sounded legit. I’d worry about being suspect. Touching dead person currently gassing up and bloating in the water. Ew."
"They’re THE. BEST. Now, how’s the dog? Lol."
"He is making sense. Jr. noticed the sandals. I’m nervous about the sandals. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC it’s sketchy."
"It’s murder. The handyman is Gardener? Funny? No? @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"ALVIN! @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC I hope it was Alvin."
"I hope Alvin is in jail. @DatelineNBC @dateline_keith"
"Exactly. I’d try something. Likely I’d be the one floating. I’d do anything to save my dog. Lol. I know. It wasn’t the dog. Stupid Alvin."
"@DatelineNBCProd OK, you must not have gotten the memo. We start each episode talking about the story arc of the dog. Is there 1? Is it ok?"
"Where do you go for her seventh bday if that’s how you do her first. Seven is nothing. @dateline_keith @DatelineNBC"
"Not sure. I can’t swim. I’m weak. I might pull head up and try."
"@DatelineNBC @dateline_keith that kid is DARLING. But this is creepy."
"Omg. Cuties. @DatelineNBC @dateline_keith I wish I had kids I could exploit. Drat."
"I’m not a fan of Alvin. Stupid Alvin. @DatelineNBC @dateline_keith"
"@Possessionista you like boots, right?"
"Not even a little. Orrible."
"It wasn’t the dog. I don’t care WHAT they say!!!"
"I found that ilarious!!!"
"If they can’t say H, why saddle baby with a name she can’t even say? @DatelineNBC"
"HOLY CRAP. THOSE KIDS! I hate things on baby’s heads but they look cute! @DatelineNBC"
"I know. Default to husband til someone else’s butt fits in the chair. That’s MY M. O."
"@DatelineNBC @dateline_keith love hard workers!!! Who don’t buy pop. Interesting detail."
"@DatelineNBC ok. Loving the Eiffel Tower/statue shot. Lol."
"Donna Summer on @DatelineNBC right?"
"NO! DON’T!!!!!"
"Florida has different standards. @DatelineNBC"
"@dateline_keith the man in black. Yes please. @DatelineNBC"

"Meh. As long as it’s pre-cake, fine by me. She goes near my cake though, she’s getting the chair."
"If I went to a church that said it did anything that did not support who I am, I’d go to another one. That’s exactly what I did."
"So? It’s a church. It’s a church that can have any kind of crazy dress code it likes. They can go to another church. It’s a church. Choice"
"This is horrible that it is news and she’s opened up to public scrutiny. I’m sure there is parental interference here."
"Great, thrilling, fun, hard-fought series. True fighters. True gentlemen. Also very scary! :) nice work!"
"Heartbroken? About clothing? On the most spiritual day of her life so far, this is the focus? That seems off."
"I used to go photograph them on cloudy days. I love cemeteries."
"Yes."
"Future? No."
"The first band of which I was aware. My first crushes. My first fan club. My first obsession in college for the resurgence. Still love them!"
