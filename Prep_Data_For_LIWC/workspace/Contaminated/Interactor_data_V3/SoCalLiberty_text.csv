"Take down MSNBC and CNN then - thanks."
"Yea - cause criminals always follow your leftist gun control laws right?"
"Good thing the agents let her go on to the hospital like the article says huh"
"Cause that’s the way to incentivize new development. Make it harder for developers to make their money back."
"No thanks. We had enough of your partisan blathering while you were on the gov’t payroll as our ineffective Senator."
"For what? What law did he break while President? Not liking his policies is not enough."
"What did you have to say when Obama said he wanted to destroy his political enemies? Hypocrite."
"Citizens and those who came here thru legal means are what? Why must Congress act to protect law breakers?"
"Sounds quite a bit like Congress. You should be used to that."
"Has anyone lied yet about the cause of the incident? You sure are a special kind of liberal dumbass to compare the two."
"Why not cut the size of gov’t to keep the deficit from increasing? And where was this concern the last 8 years?"
"Then why do tolerant liberals bully libertarians and conservatives every day in Los Angeles?"
"What the fuck does that even mean?"
"It must have been a YouTube video."
"It’s funny how liberals demand everyone accept climate science w/o question but won’t accept the science of biology."
"What does being from the same state as a judicial nominee have anything to do with it?"
"That’s the definition. Please give an example."
"Impeach for what exactly? What law has he broken since he became President. Simply not liking his politics is not enough."
"Fine - cut the size of our bloated gov’t so you and the other lousy politicians in DC won’t need as much of our money!"
"Because we need the all knowing and benevolent big govt to tell us how to live our lives and what products to buy right?"
"And yet those investigations are on going. Find anything in the last year yet? Or are you just wishing and wasting taxpayer money?"
"In other words you are going to force us to use energy sources that cost us more money because it makes you feel good about yourself. Thanks"
"Something... something... @BillClinton something... something... liberal hypocrite."
"Welcome to the world of anyone who isn’t a Democrat dumbass. Stores sell books degrading conservatives & libertarians all the time."
"And by that you mean everyone must agree with the liberal democrat agenda right?"
"Why must rewarding illegal activity be your immediate priority?"
"Because she told the truth your narrative is falling apart huh?"
"What a washed up, hypocritical, blowhard."
"Give up your taxpayer funded armed guards first then we can talk about it."
"So I have to pay for it but I don’t get any say in it huh? How about just go down to the local CVS or Walgreens and buy some condoms."
"We had to have permission from the @CAlegislature and @JerryBrownGov to capture “free” rainwater? Come off it!"
"Why “must” we support illegal activity? Please explain."
"And yet you were silent when Obama and Clinton lied to us about a YouTube video and their own obstruction - pathetic."
"Wow! You really have no clue what government should NOT be doing do you."
"Hey @Delta Fuck You & your poor customer service! Your app doesn’t work & your system arbitrarily moved me to the back of the plane."
"Wasn't Obamacare set up for failure from the beginning? Why not blame the architect ?"
"Give up your armed guards first."
"And who decides which people shouldn't have guns? Big gov't, nanny state liberals such as yourself? No thanks."
"Why are you supporting illegal activity?"
"Or we could not reward illegal activity - either way really."
"So you are ok with the artificially inflated home prices we have here in LA?"
"Sounds a lot like the passing of the ACA by Dems."
"Wouldn't it be great if you actually did something about it instead of just talking and tweeting about it."
"Or maybe telling the enemy exactly what you intend to do is a recipe for failure?"
"So why are you ok with people tearing down statues and rewriting history in the classroom?"
"Yea - that ass hat kept the rest of us under the heavy hand of big gov't! Hell of a guy!"
"Good job! more tweeting instead of bringing up a vote on it. Awesome!"
"How about you do something about it instead of tweeting about it? What are you waiting on?"
"So what are you going to do about it beside look at your phone a tweet?"
"Except for all those folks who come across the border illegally huh? Too bad @AGBecerra is such a hypocritical, political opportunist."
"We'll believe it when we see it. You spineless hacks have been talking about for far too long. Just do it."
"I had a doctor and a plan I liked and could afford then the "Affordable" Care Act came in and took both away."
"No - but Kim Jong Un blasting rockets over our allies might."
"What if we are disappointed in our Senators from California?"
"I think you mean big govt control over people's lives at stake."
"Putting more people under the heavy hand of govt bureaucracy won't make us a better nation either. Allowing the free market to work will."
"But Bill Clinton raping women was just fine huh?"
""
"We must destroy our political enemies."
"So you really think bureaucrats 2,000 miles away will make good decisions for Californians?"
"Why does the govt have to pay for health care? Why not let true free market competition bring down cost?"
"We have to pass the bill to see what's in it."
"Hey @JerryBrownGov Fuck You!"
"But spending govt funds on supporting illegal activity is a-ok huh?"
"Or it will ensure Americans will live under the heavy hand of gov't bureaucracy from the day they are born to the rest of their lives."
"You're right - Babs is a bot for the big gov't crowd."
"Nah - no need to send more tax happy, big gov't liberals to D.C. to live on the taxpayers' dime."
"Why do you constantly confuse health insurance with healthcare? You don't need one to get the other. And why should the gov't pay for this?"
"That's nice - you have a vision. Why don't you people actually do something about it since you control both the Congress and the Presidency?"
"Why is the @CAlegislature providing funds to support illegal activity?"
"A wonderful example of bloated, liberal gov't bureaucracy at it's finest!"
"Quit pussyfooting around and do it then. Or are you just another DC windbag?"
"Why does the gov't have to pay for this? If it's so important to some people start a charity have seek donations."
"Did you yet?"
"What the hell are you waiting on then? Cut taxes across the board or get the hell out so someone else can do what you are too afraid to do."
"Why do we accept "retirement" from our politicians? It's should never be a career to be a US Senator or Representative. Vote them all out!"
"Why is supporting illegal activity the 1st thing on your list?"
"How about you folks cut taxes, leave us alone, and get gov't out of the way to let the private sector do what it does best!"
"We've been ready you numbskulls. What the hell are you waiting on? Stop tweeting about it and actually pass the legislation."
"At least you can admit you are an intolerant ass."
