"Ouchie?"
"Have a great event!"
"My buddy & former neighbor is a serious STH Rams fan & tailgater. Serious! Got to be on field pregame as cancer survivor. pic.twitter.com/4uHJVI4QiL"
"I have quite a few serious RAM fan friends. Seriously tailgate all home games! An uncle was STH in Anaheim. What's going on now is a start."
"I hear you! That Sports Illustrated cover from 2014 spells it out. Astros were a mess, now at the top of the woodpile. Gotta admire that."
"Nice read, Rich! The situation also might duplicate, to a lesser degree, the LA Kings finding success after decades of mediocrity. Rams now?"
"That ring is a cruise ship!!!"
"Thank you @Dodgers for a truly great season & a nice run at the World Series title! Very appreciative of all the great memories this year! You made LA & all of your fans very proud of you, looking forward to next season! Can't thank you enough for the excitement! #ThisTeam #Proud"
"It still looks delish tho!"
"I know. The langostino reminded me of the commercial here which has been playing multiple times lately."
"My brother took his Casey to vet Tuesday to be put to sleep. She had trouble standing up, was hobbled walking, a tumor on her left lip. She was old. She lived a great life. She was glad to see everyone who visited her. She was a kind friendly soul. Got to see her Sun. Bye Casey."
"Yes. Yes I am."
"Very good idea!"
"Great idea!"
"I'll ask a serious question. DO YOU HAVE A GUN??? You could swat that thing with a baseball bat & not hurt it! It'd probably grab the bat (it's multi legged remember) and use it on you! Protect your family, do the Hero thing, & throw yourself onto it! Or RUN!!! Call the cops!"
"I agree with you!"
"I'm hating how this is starting to look. Yeah, it's early, but it's 5-0 too. #ThisTeam"
"Shoot that huge spider first before he gets away & breeds 100's more. #HateBigSpiders"
"Planning well is always a good thing!"
"That referee isn't going to stand up & announce to the restaurant he'll have the tater tots, since his wife is having the langostino? It's a funny commercial!"
