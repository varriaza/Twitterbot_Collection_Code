"What's racist about it?"
"It can easily be interpreted that way, and in fact there is that implication. But it goes to show that you can find offense anywhere."
"And this was also not racist in the slightest. The skin tone in the before and after doesn't even change, genius, doesn't correspond to them"
"More like, SJWs never quit with their race baiting nonsense. The ad was not racist. It was saying the soap is for everyone."
"They only apologized because they care about PR, not because you ever had a point. They were a million miles from trying to be racist, obv."
"The only thing they missed was that people intent on reading racism into everything would be on their case over something that wasn't."
"You sound racist."
"So what were they doing when in the very next moment they had the white woman turn into an Asian woman in that ad? Temporary bleach?"
"It's not racist to root for someone just because they're black, but I suppose it would be if you did the same for whites? lol at SJWs."
"More like: SMH that people like you will force a racialized narrative into everything. The ad was not remotely racist."
"And then what's happening in the very next moment when the white woman changes into being Asian? Fit your narrative? LOL"
""If you're offended by someone saying ________, it's a good indication that you're a motherfucking _________." Think about it and fuck you."
"That's basically just the interpretation of the perpetually offended race baiters and their dupes. It's soap for all skin types."
"The ad is obviously about how people of all skin types can use this soap. The white woman turns Asian next. lol"
"Well, you are obviously a perpetually offended person that cannot be pleased, anyway."
"In protest of something you deem racist, you say something that actually borders on racism. Imagine if you said that about whites"
"It seems like saying "mansplaining" really often means "stop lording having more knowledge than me when you're a man and I'm a woman.""
"Yeah, you can only hear how terrible white males and how they need to be stripped of imagined "privilege" so much before you react."
"They're implying that the public at large doesn't think that black lives matter which is insulting and stupid. That's the issue"
"You mean they are starting to come around to how bad they actually are instead of ignoring, denying. Also realizing how bad they are for PR"
