"What information can he falsify that would give him the leeway to kill a man in cold blood?"
"Not at all in all honestly. Police officers have cameras on the outside of their vehicles and in their vehicles."
"No no no. I'm not justifying Yanez at all. I wouldn't want to. But I am looking at the reality of the facts."
"So was it racism? I don't think so. The only other conclusion is that the information provided to them convinced them he was not guilty."
"Was it racism? Two of the jury were black. The rest were different races. Two were even let go for being biased toward Yanez."
"I agree, but I don't see why a jury of Philando Castile's peers would find the officer not guilty."
"It's the responsibility of every officer to write his own report. Who else would write it for him, him being alone at the being?"
"or maybe there are things about it that aren't being said. Things that don't have clear answer need research. Not instant conclusions."
"That's a reasonable thing for a police department to do with it having so much media coverage."
"There's a certain build up to hysterics. It doesn't just happen."
"That's what I'm pointing out. I have watched the video about 100 times maybe. You don't just stop someone and b/come hysterical."

"True but what I was pointing out was that we had more than equal representation on that jury."
"And that is the question of the day. We don't know what happened. There is only an afterwards video. It doesn't explain mush."
"On that, I can agree but the "why" of why Officer Yanez felt the need to shoot in the first place I will look for until I find it."
"2 out of 12... you say. So are we assuming that the rest of the jury was white, or Hispanic like Yanez?"
"And you know what, that's about how it should have been. We're only a lot 13% of US population. that was the right amount of rep."
"I don't believe that this officer would open fire on a man because of his race. So I will find the truth."
"What you guys don't understand is not defending anyone here. I just want the truth of it."
"It's information that no one has shared about him. I want the truth of what happened."
"The jury over that case had two African Americans. I doubt that they would have said the officer was innocent if he was guilty."
"I agree with that. But what I don't agree with is claiming that the did nothing wrong without proof of that claim."
"Tell me how then. And then tell me why most Democrat cities in America have higher crime rates than Republican cities?"

"Whoever vandalized this building hates Trump. If they loved Trump they would paint "vote hillary""
"Yes the Klan is against Republicans(white or black)."
"Trump said he wants to block out "illegal" immigrants. Trump is married to an immigrant, I don't think he hates immigrants."
"Also she said that Half were deplorable and the other half were basement dwellers I heard her say it. It's division @an extreme."
"@bemusickaIn In what world is deplorable nicer than ignorant?? Are being serious?"
"That's THE moment when I stop supporting her dude. Then a friend got me reading wikileaks and I been a Hillary hater since."

"like this."
"Yea you too man. Don't believe everything you hear just because it supports a certain narrative ok? Not many people are evil"
"Dude even stupid people aren't this stupid. This borderline retarded not just stupid. This isn't logical that it's even a story"
"If Trump supporters did this don't you think they would paint "Vote Hillary" and NOT "Vote Trump"."
"If some wanted Trump to win they would've painted "Vote Hillary" this makes no sense and I think you know that."
"Only a fool doesn't know that the KKK claim to support Hillary as well. But that's not what's being discussed."
"Anyone who did that wants Trump to lose. I don't support Trump(or Killary) and even I can see that."
"Are you an idiot? Anyone who supports Trump wouldn't do this The person that did this wants Trump to lose lol"

"Why spray paint "vote Trump" afterwards then? It sounds like they hate Trump and don't want him to win."
"I don't support Trump but why would Trump supporters vandalize a building to "help" Trump win? MSM thinks we are stupid Vote Trump"
"Considering people supporting Trump actually WANT him to win, who do you think really vandalized that church? Vote Trump"
"The only people who would do that is people who want him to lose the election. Think a little bit. Vote trump."
"Why would anyone who WANTS black people to"vote Trump" burn down their church? If you believe this story, you're a fool."
"Why would people burn a building and then say vote Trump? does that narrative make any sense? think about it a lil."
"How would this gain Trump support? CNN you're fucking stupid.wow.. Vote Trump."
"Why would someone burn a church and paint "Vote Trump" on it? How would that gain Trump support? Use that tiny brain. Vote Trump."
"She is.I'm voting Trump too. You can't see it but I'm black as well."
"You're disgusting. I'm voting for that fucker Trump JUST because of you. If you gonna cheat don't get caught u fuckin stupid."
"Dude she cheated our Democracy. @donnabrazile rigged the debate. You're ok with that?"
"So Obama said "Men Are Sexist" if they don't vote for Hillary this election cycle. The fuck is our country's leader thinking y'all?"
"Am I sexist cause I don't want to vote for a criminal? Fucked up world we live in y'all. "Men Are Sexist""
"Am I sexist for NOT voting Hillary? Or am I sexist for voting Trump? Which is it? "Men Are Sexist""
"All white people are racist, all straight people are homophobic, and all men are sexist? Basically you're bad if you vote Trump. SMFH Obama."

"for government to "govern" it's citizen & to "help" us run our lives through that same dependence."
"like you would think of drug dependence... If we continue down this road of dependence, eventually it will open the door"
"The more that citizen depend on government assistance the weaker the populace and country grows. Think of those services"
"Not only does big government create higher tax rates, it also creates a higher level of citizen to government dependence."
"extremely heavily on Gov assistant programs. I think that that's the inherit flaw of bigger(e.g. more services) government"
"needed. I don't agree with Gov being in healthcare but I see the need for it b/c at this point in our society people rely"
"Your borrowed opinions are intriguing. As far as services the Gov provides, public safety, transport & healthcare are"
"about 30k+ emails that were deleted. Why, i don't know but that's the only possible explanation that would make any sense."
"emails. From what I gather the FBI subpoenaed all emails from Hillary and her staff during the investigation. There were"
"I've followed the email situation rather closely, & my impression is that the FBI must have found the deleted Hillary"
"because I negotiated my salary. I'm not more qualified and I don't have more experience. I'm talking from experience."
"I don't think that's the case because I'm black and I've been in my job less time than my white co-workers and I get paid more>>"
"I'm going purely off of what you told me. You said they offered her more because of her race."
"I understand why you took the job but you did take the job. I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I'm talking about business."
"That's the reason I'm asking for a link."
"My research says that there is no wage gap. There is a choices gap but not a wage gap."
"isn't right, because you signed the contract. They didn't force you."
"By signing that contract, you said to them,"I will work for this amount of money." To now say that they SHOULD'VE paid you more"
"I'm trying to be respectful here by saying, you took less. That has nothing to do with your race. You signed a contract for less"
"At the start did you negotiate your salary& job responsibilities? Or did you ask and were told no and you just accepted it."
"So you gained a degree while working there?"
"#AnnoyPeopleInTheWaitingRoom Grandma Hillary Clinton, falling asleep for a 5 hour nap on your shoulder. *shudder* Eww."
"And she had less education than you? Also did you negotiate your salary& job responsibilities and did she?"
"Can you explain farther? In what way were you being underpaid?"
"Good talk! This how Politics SHOULD be discussed."
"You and I agree 100% here then. I don't respect your choice at all but I respect your right and ability to choose."
"I must be able to live with myself."
"I couldn't forgive myself if I did that. I barely stand myself voting for Trump, but I can't forgive myself voting Hillary."
"So if someone supports Trump will you talk down to them for making their own choice?"
"Oops! I didn't. I forgot that noun."
"degrade us and make fools of us."
"I'd like us to all get along and not insult. This isn't about side it's about we the people. We're letting ALL politicians>>>"
"No. Don't point the finger like that. Both sides do it. Hillary did it and Trump did it. ALL do it."
"I said Hillary said it. A man who calls himself shit doesn't you warrant you to call him shit."
"All of these remarks are insults driven by politicians at dividing the American people. THAT is truly deplorable my friend,"
"called them a basket of deplorables. Does that truly make sense to you?"
"So, me calling Trump supporters "deplorables" is not an insult because some few call themselves deplorable after>>>>"
"Also "Trumpophile" is without doubt a bigoted smear right?"
"Just like Hillary supporters embrace "nasty woman"? Does that make it any less of an insult?"
"Isn't it funny that Hillary called Americans supporting Trump deplorable but none of them has done bad things like "Alicia Machado""
"The two studies pay vastly different amounts."
"7 times more."
"In fact women graduate with degrees in education 5 times more often than men and men graduate with degrees in science around>>>"
"Yes they do but not by almost 40%. 29% of men graduate college and 40% of women graduate from college."
"How is Machado a good rolemodel for women? This is looks bad on Hillary."
"I don't know why she's letting Alicia Machado campaign with her. She's not a good Latina or womens rolemodel..."
"intensive work fields than men."
"In fact there are more women in college than men, more women graduating college than men, and more women in less labor"
"I have research it extensively an used to think all American women were paid less than American men. But it just isn't true."
"What's considered a bigoted smear? I would consider calling anyone voting Trump "deplorable" a bigoted smear no?"
"So you believe Latina Americans are paid half of what a white dude is paid. Even with minimum wage?"
"Shouldn't you be calling it defensive attack? She attacked their candidate and the attacked her defensively."
"How is it racist to call Alicia Machado a prostitute? I thought prostitutes get paid for sex like she did."
"What research? Can you link me?"
"My boss is Latina and younger than me by two years. I'm sure it's not true. Maybe for illegal Latinas. Not Americans though."
"I thought it was 51 cents... someone else said 54 cents... now you say 58 cents on the dollar. #LatinaEqualPay Lies? I think so"
"are these Americans Latinas or illegal Latinas? There IS a difference right? #LatinaEqualPay"
"Equal pay or equal earnings? They're two different things."
"I'm black and went to an all white school and work in a 75% white company and make more than most of my co-workers."
"I'm sure the majority of people's experiences are like hers."
"Wow you NAILED IT!"
"That is untrue. My female boss is Latina and she's younger than me."
"Good for you. Don't support the party that perpetuates the #LatinaEqualPay BS. Anyone who works hard can get anywhere in life."
"You are very unreasonable. Good day."
"I've looked up Hillary and Donald. I don't like Donald or Hillary."
"Can you show me where Trump was a prostitute? I've tried to google it and there's noting there."
"I said Alicia Machado doesn't represent Latinos being that she is a prostitute. I have no problem with her."
"I learned that from CNN. CNN never said anything about Trump being a prostitute."
"Funny someone else just tweeted 150 years and another person tweeted 235 years. Which is it?"
"When did this happen? Also I've yet to insult you, and you continue with your insults."
"Getting paid for sex is prostitution. That's not an insult toward you in any case."
"How have I ever insulted you? I've never talked to you before."
"Yep don't voteHillary then. She pays women in her campaign less than men."
"I have"
"So that gives you the right to talk down to me as a human being, calling me deplorable?"
"Then don't vote for Hillary. She pays the women in her campaign a lot less. Look it up."
"She hasn't fought for it in 24 years... Democrats take advantage of minorities."
"Is this happening to Latino Americans or illegal Latinos?"
"Yep. They are the ones hurting the minorities. have been for 50 years."
"She's taxing the rich but also giving them MORE loophole to NOT pay taxes. Read her policies."
"I haven't insulted you at all why are you insulting me?"
"Is the unfair wage thing happening to Latino Americans or illegal Latinos? #LatinaEqualPay"
"Is this happening to Latino Americans or illegal Latinos?"
"Sir how much were you making in what year? And are you legally in this country?"
"I'm not. I haven't seen any be racist again Latinos. I've see Hillary call Latinos needy tho."
"#VoteTrump He pays all people the same as long as they do a good job. And he wants t de-corrupt the white house."
"This isn't true. You're lying."
"Noo one has attacked her race. Alicia Machado does not represent Latinos. #BadRolemodel ."
"Right."
"I should tell my daughters to support a pornstar/suspect of murder and a corrupt politician who wanted to rig the Iraq election?"
"They never mention when Hillary has fought for women, they just say she has in the past. Tell me when she has."
"Funny how Hillary called her supports "stupid"."
"Alicia Machado: "Donald Rump do not stand for women rights." But she stands for women's rights by prostituting herself? Sounds Legit."
"Thank you. Omg this meme is literally the heart of the matter."
"America already does #LatinaEqualPay . BTW why is Alicia Machado trending? Doesn't this hurt Latinas? Her being an anal pornstar and all?"
"Wanna know what else is "on the ballot this year"? #hillaryforprison . yep that."

"What then becomes a factor is whether the allegations are paid-off by the clinton campaign, which is highly likely."
"Good :) me to, I love it. Politics is my great passion."
"out of 452 suicide bombing 450 were Muslims. That is not a fabrication. That's a fact. In THAT light Islamophobia is reasonable."

"I wish I was. I've listened to the hearings at least three times."

"A claim must be back by facts to proven true. None of the women have remotely tried to prove anything."
"Sharon they found classified government information on ALL of the devices she didn't try and destroy first."
"Yes but he wasn't "caught" with it. Just like if I smoked crack but wasn't caught I wouldn't be sent to jail."
"nothing else makes sense either. So the fact that they can't be substantiated is proof the allegations are untrue."
"The allegations can't be substantiated, unless one of his accusers is withholding information, which wouldn't make any sense, but"
"with classified information on them."
"That's called off-site. And they all had government classified information on them. That also is illegal to have multiple devices"
"Sharon she had three servers that were off-site. One in her bathroom(of all places), her basement, and in different location."
"Ok Sharon how do you know that's accurate if they weren't caught?"
"No but deleting emails that are court subpoenaed is always the same action."
"!!!!! Sharon think logically please. Trump is now being called a SEXIST SEXUAL ABUSER. THAT IS DAMAGE OR REPUTATION."
"off-site government server which also is on ground for termination and legal action."
"Ok you aren't defending Hillary. Nothing you've said can excuse the deletion court subpoenaed documents OR the creation private"
"What was my generalization?"
"The accusations are on tape and video. It wouldn't be hard."
"Are you being serious? If someone publicly accuses you of a crime and they can't prove it, you can sue said person for defamation."
"No. that's breaking the law openly and getting off because of who you are. That has 0% to do with knowing Law."
"A general was just sent to prison for "mishandling" classified information. Many Military Official for less than what Hillary did."
"I would sue someone who defamed me publicly as would anyone. When accused of lies most people deny them."
"I just know 100% that if you or I was in that courtroom, you or I would rot in prison."
"No what she did was illegal. Deleting court subpoenaed emails is illegal. I don't care about any new scandals honestly."
"And again we're going with non-information. There isn't proof Trump have done that. If there was I wouldn't be voting."
"Yes and she was subpoenaed."
"No the picture is inferring that. I didn't take or make the picture. I all i said was check it out."
"Deleting court subpoenaed emails. That is 100% against the law."
"I'm not reaching for anything. It's just more information as far as I'm concerned."
