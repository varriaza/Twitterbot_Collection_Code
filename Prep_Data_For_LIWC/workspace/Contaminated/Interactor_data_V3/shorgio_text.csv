"And you’re avoiding my question: what would you do about mass shootings? And if you say “treat mental illness” pls explain how"
"(And Australia style confiscation is not the current gun control agenda anyway. You’re being paranoid)"
"Confiscation of semi-automatic and automatic rifles would not violate current 2A precedent though. So why are you talking about 2A repeal?"
"So you admit that Heller and MacDonald were handgun cases, right? And that 2A repeal talk is (at best) premature and thus a strawman?"
"Yeah... you’re 100% wrong on that buddy."
"What would you do though?"
"The 2A doesn’t protect anyone’s right to an AR-15 or to unregistered ownership or sale. So you’re creating a straw man about repeal. Why?"
"So what would you do to stop mass shootings? Or would you suggest nothing?"
"Who cares about his motive or lack thereof? You can’t regulate evil *intent* but you can regulate the capabilities of “evil”"

"The whole debate is whether the Stephen Paddocks in the world are in 1-22 or in 23-40."
"Yes, but from 40 to 22 is progress. I can accept that perfection is impossible to attain given gun culture"
"You're not?"
"So, by that logic, gun control laws work."
"Question since I know you're pro-2A: aren't you sick of these mass shootings? What would you do about it?"
"I just think the argument is like saying, "if you ban weed, only criminals will smoke weed." Um, no. Weed smokers will smoke weed."
"I'd be willing to wager most mass shooters are also well-versed in being Pro-2A. At a minimum, it's good cover."
"No, I'm saying "if guns are illegal, only gun nuts will have guns." Criminals will simply perpetrate crimes without guns."
"Gun nuts see the world as "Saints vs. Sinners" when in actuality, its "Gun Nuts vs. Everyone Else." Gun nuts will try to cheat the system."
"Conversely, lots of "criminals" are otherwise pillars of society. It's not like its all angels vs. devils out there."
"This notion of "law abiding" vs "criminal" is kinda simplistic, no? Lots of "law abiding" people drive over the speed limit, or smoke weed."
"Either laws work or they don't. You can't have it both ways."
"But what about the black market? A true-blue citizen who likes guns can always get what they want, right? Just buy from a criminal."
"If gun control laws don't work, then why do gun rights advocates oppose them?"
"Also here's a paradox: if gun control laws don't work, why do you oppose them?"
"Your silence is deafening: where do you draw the line?"
"You know what Twitter needs to do? Find everyone who tweets that Las Vegas was a "false flag," and ban them."
"My position is simply this: if your Congressperson believes in gun rights, fine... but stop taking NRA campaign money. It's blood money."
"Anyway, the 2nd Amendment (even post-Heller) doesn't protect your right to an AK-47 or AR-15. Those aren't "self-defense" weapons."
"By your logic, why are we mad at Kim Jong-Un for building nuclear weapons and ICBMs? Isn't self-defense a human right?"
"It's a critique of the faulty logic of blaming mass systems for deaths. Capitalism certainly has killed more than communism."
"It gives no advice at all. Tell me: where would you draw the line? What limits would you put on weapons ownership? What arguments work 4u"
"Ask yourself: should violent felons be disenfranchised from owning guns? Should an ISIS terrorist be banned from buying an AK-47?"
"The answer is: you don't care about the Constitution. You just want your guns. There's no debating this with you."
"Well, it doesn't live up to its title, which makes it fraudulent. It doesn't explain what arguments would be convincing to you."
"I'm a civil rights attorney. I fight to protect Constitutiona rights all the time. I don't need some idiot re-reading Heller to me."
"I watched most of it. It doesn't live up to its title, has terrible legal / historical analysis, is nothing new, and the guy's voice sucks"
"By your logic, the South and West Sides of Chicago should be the safest area of town. Lots of guns on those streets."
"Um, lots of people had guns at Route 91."
"Also, this ignores that despite guns, our 1st Am liberties are being destroyed right now. Tyranny is happening now. Guns = false security"
"The title is "How to Argue for Gun Control" and yet the author never explains how to argue, just makes anti-gun-control arguments."
"The answer is clear: same reason we can't yell "fire" in a crowded movie theater. Constitutional rights are always subject to exceptions"
"You're not a Constitutional lawyer (I am). But riddle me this: if the right to bear arms is sacrosanct, why can't we bring guns on planes?"

"C, RT and RG are blocking nobody"
"We are having the same debate every time. It gets tiring. No need to get angry. I get your point I hope you get mine."
"I pray you talk to a victim of mass gun violence and learn that love of God has nothing to do with sensible gun control"
"Well, you don't *know* that, and your *fear* lets hundreds of thousands die. Do you ever talk to victims of mass gun violence, Father?"
"Yeah, I think Trump sucks. Doesn't everyone?"
"Satan most definitely is a Wolf in Sheep's clothing. I don't claim to be holy or a preacher of god. I'm definitely not Satan."
"Again, you keep twisting my words. Very tricky, Satan."
"What do you think of Trump?"
"No, because it's not 50, it's 1.7 million dead, and there's no real risk of "genocide" or "democide" (and handguns wouldn't stop it)"
"Yeah good luck with that. "ISIS" claims a lot these days, doesn't mean it's true. Also, irrelevant. ISIS shouldn't be able to get guns."
"Your values are "love, joy, peace" and GUNS FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING THE INSANE. Your values are DEAD KIDS. Sickening and pathetic."
"If you're just going to spout off the SAME OLD B.S. lines, then we are done here. Wake up. You are the problem."
"First - no one is saying "ban all guns." Second - stop with the "what would we do" crap. Your paranoid fanatasies --> 500+ dead / maimed"
"Ok, well be honest: this has nothing to do with "God." These mass shootings and dead and maimed are all because of your evil "values""
"Founding fathers did not imagine automatic weapons. Stick to religion, you're a terrible lawyer."
"Because I live here. Plus, you're missing the point: MASS SHOOTINGS is the problem, not day-to-day gang violence."
"Is that how it works? And I dunno, I'm old school. If I can't win in 140 then I won't win with 280"
"You, sir, are the heart of wickedness and evil. Using "God" to advance your nakedly political agenda."
"IN CHICAGO"
"The 2nd Amendment isn't in the Bible."
"You are changing the subject. Love of God has nothing to do with whether the Founding Fathers intended individuals to own automatic weapons"
"You say "it's inevitable" as if Austrialia, Great Britain, Canada, Japan, and all of Europe simply doesn't exist. USA is the outlier"
"How about the next time someone kills or maims 500+ people in 15 minutes at a distance of 1200 feet with a knife or car, we revisit?"
"Or it could've been prevented by strict gun laws. WHY NOT BOTH"
"Otherwise, all you are doing is changing the subject. Which is the Devil's handiwork."
"Answer my question: why is this "either/or"? Why can't you preach your God AND also promote Gun Control on Earth?"
"By the way, this effing sucks. You have 280 characters and I have 140."
"Gun crimes have gone WAY UP since gun control was stricken down by the Courts"
"Why not make it *more difficult* for "bad apples" to kill and main 500 in 15 minutes?"
"Great, we agree. Teach nice things, good values. ALSO gun control. Why is this an "either/or" discussion?"
"Ok what about the 58 dead and 500 wounded though. That could have been prevented."
"No, you're assuming people are "immutably" evil. You say "teach Christian values." Fine. Why is that inconsistent with "gun control laws"?"
"You're straw-manning me! I never said jack about handguns."
"Ask yourself: why is it "either/or"? Why can't you promote your religion AND support gun control? What in the scripture says otherwise?"
"Truth of Jesus sure failed 500+ in Las Vegas last night."
"You're assuming that people are born evil, born criminal, and are immutably so. Very un-Christian."
"So we should have no police, no courts, no laws? Just vigilantes armed to the teeth? Ask yourself: why only in the USA?"
"That's just your opinion. There is nothing that you've said that is "truth". You are using that so-called "truth" to block real solutions"
"So we should have no laws then? Murderers will always murder, rapists will always rape, thieves will always steal?"
"Attempting to block the deeds of good with words and platitudes is evil."
"You say "blame Evil" which is inchoate, as a diversion from discussing real policy solutions. That to me is the work of the Devil."
"Look at the news. You are the personification of evil, using the Bible to cover up and excuse hideous mass murder."
"And I meant "injured" not killed."
"Gun culture = glorification of evil. Guns are a sign of moral weakness, not strength, of corruption of the soul, not liberty."
"The car killed 1 person in C'ville. Automatic weapon killed 500+. And I am saying "change hearts." Change gun culture."
"Maybe we can’t solve evil but we can make evil harder. Why wouldn’t you want that? Or is your solution “Christian Theocracy”?"
"Gun culture is why Nevada has the loosest laws on the books. A gun is a tool, not a toy. We don’t let anyone drive Semi Trucks."
"I agree we need to change gun culture, stop the glorification of guns. Laws can have a signaling effect. Also, you’re wrong: see Australia"
"No problem Boris. (Hint: your twitter handle gives you away)"
"We don’t have laws preventing evil"
"N"
"Note the Russian spelling for “sandwich”"
"So we shouldn’t pass laws to protect or promote the good and prevent and punish evil?"
"Whatever, Sergei."
"Glad you can find a laugh out of an invented straw man instead of addressing the epidemic of mass shootings in America."
"I'm like a broken record, but it's not just gun control we need. We need to change Gun Culture."
