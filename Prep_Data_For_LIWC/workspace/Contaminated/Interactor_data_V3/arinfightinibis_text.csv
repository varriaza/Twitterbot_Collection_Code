"Especially with how damn good the first season was. Probably the biggest television letdown ever for me, though I’m still pretty young"
"Yes, that was a pretty poor writing decision for sure. I just feel the overall terribleness of TD S2 is worse than that of FNL"
"Jon Richt going to watch Jarren Williams tonight"
"Man over half the defense was out for that game. Rough night lol"
"Right. ABC forced them to reveal the killer early and they weren’t prepared so it just meandered. True Detective S2 by far the worst IMO"
"Gotcha! Makes sense. Should look sweet"
"Lol yeah that’s true, but I was wondering if they just meant certain players or what"
"y tho https:// twitter.com/theueqroom/sta tus/926525786416472067 …"
"Man you’ve been trolling hard lately"
"I wouldn’t be shocked if they beat us, but predicting a 2 TD loss when we’re fully healthy (Other than MW)? That’s just straight no faith"
"Pretty sure like half our defense was out for last year’s VT game"
"Damn, quick browse through the comments and a reality check that everyone hates Miami https:// twitter.com/espncfb/status /926128819945254912 …"
"For only the small price of $1000, you can order your own! https:// twitter.com/apple/status/9 23965526778540032 …"
"Don’t think he understands how this trolling thing works"
"Ayyy AH pipeline. https:// twitter.com/drew_chatfield /status/926235601300582400 …"
"“Aside from”? Those are two pretty damn good passing offenses. One beat Clemson the week before we played them"
"Since we beat em, Syracuse is apparently garbage. Let’s just ignore the fact they beat Clemson the week before we played them. pic.twitter.com/55tabCXLJu"
"Noooo! Damn it. He’ll come back stronger than before tho https:// twitter.com/adamschefter/s tatus/926193425917063169 …"
"I told y’all. Mike Rumph is the real deal. https:// twitter.com/pff_college/st atus/926181913479565312 …"
"Thats if Ahmmon doesn’t drop 100 balls"
"VT’s biggest road games to this point have been ECU and BC. And if Malik’s shoulder is fully healthy, we tearing that secondary to shreds"
"Her shit so obviously fake and it hurts to watch. Hate when celebs (people in general) take plastic surgery and what not too far https:// twitter.com/kimkardashian/ status/925602471925268480 …"
"Tough for sure, but not possible? That’s just ridiculous"
"Probably true. Either way he has yet to look that great but I’m sure he’ll be highly recruited again if he leaves and goes juco"
"He “flipped” to Rutgers tho https:// twitter.com/smithnoland2/s tatus/925886176455725056 …"
"Don’t want Eason here, he’ll be a back up to Perry unless he gets a lot better. Need to go HARD after a QB this class."
"Yep, I’ve watched him and he didn’t look good even before he got hurt. Fromm, a true frosh, came in and the offense took off"
"Wait, Sitkowski decommitted? YES. That’s a parting of ways, gentleman."
"Don’t see Emory, but maybe the rest. Didn’t we already try with DTR and he didn’t have much interest? Maybe Brevin can talk some sense"
"Kid reminds me so much of Sapp, both attitude and play https:// twitter.com/baezjr_/status /925780103132573698 …"
"Do it! One of my favorites, of course"
"We were also missing at least half our defense to injury, haha. We’re going in much healthier this year"
"Freewheelin’"
"Damn I really hope they try to man up on our WRs, and even Homer. Foster is smart tho, if he starts out like that he’ll adjust quickly"
"Or even better, if we get matched up with UCF, whoop dat ass and the Gators then hire Frost"
"Why are so many people freaking out? This isn’t even that complicated https:// twitter.com/earnknowledge/ status/923736775914274816 …"
"I have nooo idea man.. does look weird but again I don’t know what the whole conspiracy would be, don’t really see a purpose lol"
"Woooow for real? Yeah that’s weird bro. Guess it’s not imossible, but you’d have to think, if staging it, they’d do much better"
"Where is that from exactly? Something official or just a “source”? Because that’s not even fit for a YouTube short film"
"Eh.. need more than that. And I just don’t see what the whole conspiracy would be. Doubt it was one shooter but other than that, idk"
