"Haven't You Heard, I'm Sakamoto It's in Japanese subs tho"
"2. Cry me a river after 500 years of what you did to everyone else, mmk?"
"Haha. White people so scared out here. The gig is up and people are completely over y'all."
"A LOT"
"Which means absolutely nothing for anyone. Haha"
"4. Telling enemies and allies apart is not so difficult : what are their priorities and how do they act? Too many lies are difficult to keep"
"3. There is science and spirit, truth and lies, used against us at all times. We are enemies. There are others who crave war even more."
"2. Everyone is accountable. People - groups and individuals - are accountable in different measures. There is right and wrong."
"This world shouldn't exist. We got here because there were and are people who want it that way. There are enemies. This is a war for Life."
"If being a human means being as simple as I see others being.. Then I was never that."
"No. This little girl shouldn't exist in the first place."
"Yeah. Like how fucked up our world is. We have the tech to fix this. But govt keeps it hidden. Suppressed tech is well known."
"If the situation on this planet between white supremacists, terrorists, and other types who are against progress.."
"3. This why the fuck we ain't gonna get no where and why all our conclusions and brilliance come to naught. Lack of cohesion and sense."
"2. I'm out here trying to confront black fam on what I think they're doing. On what illness I see in their perception. But no, I'm wrong!"
"Hey: it is my history too. Twitter is for communication and sharing ideas. If you don't want that then Wtf is I but an echo chamber?!"
"So many are going to stay slaves and not know why."
""
"There are more and more of us out here seeing an imbalance in how our community sees and acts. Trying to bring light to it."
"We can't keep acting like we have no blame in this, though. We can't act like we are completely innocent and ONLY victims as a people."
"3. We can give whites their proper due. That doesn't mean to turn around and do the same or worse to them. That's sickness."
"2. Giving everything it's proper due is necessary. But people : you can't be superior w/o facing the whole truth and overcoming it."
"Are we really going to act like we don't do sick shit to our own people and never have though? That's the same delusion everyone else has."
"@TheGiftedonFOX Doesn't see how this show is ironically related to @Kaepernick7 and #BlackLivesMatter https:// twitter.com/TheGiftedonFOX /status/906547771519361025 …"
"What is the name of the original version?"
"Oh you can't say we may need to turn to violence. Cause that is too extreme when you're already being murdered all the time."
"What privilege and arrogance does BLM have besides standing up to white supremacists? Tell me how dangerous blacks are."
"UNTIL ALL OF THEM ARE GONE. FTFY"
"Oh my god but I am so sick of that shit. Been on this for two decades now. :/"
"Hm. Too bad I don't meet those who can truly help me further my journey by leaps and bounds. Only people who fight or are apathetic."
"I guess you would know."
"But you don't think we should do it as often as fasting from food? Why or why not? I think we should, considering our society."
"3. We know these things that happen in our world, are not merely mistakes. That they are contrived by people. Conscious and not."
"2. Many institutions, in America and elsewhere, by reason of their design and handlers, destroy lives. No one can deny this. Yet we here."
"What do you think about sexual fasting."
"America, like other govts, play both side of wars and has since its inception. For its own interest, this govt has destroyed lives."
"I'm not one a pacifist. If it cannot be resolved peacefully and in justice, then I guess some violence will be necessary."
"Why do you think the current establishment tries so hard to trivialize spirit and the connectedness of reality?"
"2. From what I can tell God's children know they are bc they are shown by Spirit they are. I have been shown that many many times."
"Uh huh. I read the verse. Very beautiful, but uninformative in a practical sense."
"Can y'all explain how you know an Israelite from other people? How you know you're one of God's chosen? A sign or a mark?"
"I know better than that! Some of these disagreements are just plain cover ups for discoveries that can't be made public yet."
"Even if it were true I don't see how that's helping black folks right now develop something better than this system."
"http://www. newsweek.com/yellowstone-su pervolcano-quake-swarm-646712 … @EsotericExposal @futurism @ZodMagus @NidaKhanNY @blueavians @realDonaldTrump End days, bitches!"
"Man I was really asking that dude about it. It doesn't make sense. Why fixate on that, of all things?"
"If the most high doesn't love everyone, then how do you identify who he loves? Now, I mean. Is there a mark, a sign on them?"
"Can you elaborate, please."

"Blood like ice. This is what rap music is about."
"Do you know this happened in August as well?"
"It is literally this. More than one God gets cheated on. Lol."
"3. Just like he created Satan and a being with original sin. Haha"
"2. God made everything. Means he made gay and trans people. Means he made them that way. Lol."
"So Satan made gay people with God's power."
"People mad. What a shock."
"4. And every goddamn time someone tries to get free these nonwhite establishments get in the way. To the detriment of EVERYONE."
"3. No body wants a war with you. People want true freedom. But who controls most major establishments? Not blacks or Arabs or Jews."
"2. This is what your problem is white folks: you keep running away from the bad you've done while trying to take credit for everything else."
"The guys an idiot and that long ass rant proved it. All that to avoid accountability for what white colonialism has done. As usual."
"5. Lastly: none of what you say makes ANYTHING I HAVE SAID OR WILL SAY untrue. Blow your pseudointellectualism out your ass. No one's fooled"
"4. You want the truth, so you say! Yet it is WHITE PEOPLE who destroy and steal and hide history from EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE."
"3. I want the truth! Wtf do you people exist of basically all you do is enslave one another and everything you come across?!"
"2. I know so much BS from you white folks. It is all kumbaya when people SEE YOU and point out these things. Now it's all magic. Ha!"
"Let me tell you something: none of what you said stops white supremacy from existing. Period. This is still reality."
"Fuck patience. It is 2017 and we're all dying out here, whether we want to admit that or not."
"Exactly. How about y'all remove yourselves from white supremacist structures.. Then we work the bad feels out?"
"I'm crying. I want us black folk to get on cannabis as healing mind, body, soul"
"Now that people SEE YOU and want to solve the issue of YOU and white supremacy.. Now it's racist. Now it's a problem. Now we're all human."
"Y'all won. But now you don't want to take credit for winning the colonialism game. Funny and convenient now that people SEE YOU."
"White supremacy = whites writing history, being oppressors, rapists, and otherwise apathetic and ineffective against what benefits them."
"2. I'd much rather have the planet clean and full of life and how it was vs this bullshit people think is so great!"
"Maybe if whites hadn't colonized the world and forced everyone into a fucked up industrial "revolution" we wouldn't be here."
"All whites. 2"
"All whites. 1"
"All whites."
"UFO are both -- ancient and recent. Recent by those who stole and discover. Ancient by the descendants and originators."
"Exactly. But who controls these schools of thought for the most part? Yet: We still have the evidence whites are young! Only 7000 yr old!"
"It's not bigotry if you're saying the truth. We are all sick in this society. Whites are sick in their own way bc that's how this works!"
"@marcuspeters pic.twitter.com/1eVWZd4fIP"
"2. If you care about Earth and you care about black folks, you will get in contact. I will screenshot for evidence."
"@marcuspeters I don't want anything to do with this world and how it destroys everything it touches. Get in contact. Period."
"Actually: most people don't want anything to do with this world and what it does if they are sane!"
"2. If blacks or anyone else do it less: that is what being poor is."
"White people doing this more between them"
"Satan = God"
"Wow. You're dumb. Were already There."

"I want to live w/o being interfered with. Period. Not by the govt, not by whites, not by anyone. Fuck capitalism and all this shit."
"GOAL: This world ending ASAP."
"Tell me how to make people do what I want. Tell me how to make people do what I want."
"3. Looking for an honest and simple answer. Cause I've heard the rest of the company line."
"2. Esp. considering what has become of these traditions : how is identifying with such beliefs really going to get us out of this?"
"Judaism is fairly young in comparison to other Aborigine / black traditions. Still don't see why it is something to fixate on."
"Noooooooope"
"3. I can see the same things happening to you too. Only thing is this: people don't want to admit there are better and worse people."
"2. When I say the things I do people see something simple mostly because THEY are simple."
"You see this in social movements. Over simplifying, bias, lack of holistic thinking etc etc"
"I don't think white people know--when we criticize their systems--we're also criticizing them and expect results from that critique."
