"And a Cadillac margarita !"
"TGI Fridays"
"You fucking morons really need this to be breaking news in 2017? Are you all neanderthals?"
"Wow. You're dumb."
"Same"
"I see the difference. But we should be demanding much better from Dems and the Dem party."
"I just don't think human rights are something we compromise on"
"But I have very little hope that Dems would actually do that since it doesn't affect them"
"If I lived there, I would hold my nose and vote. But I would also be at his door and the Dems party door today, and be ready to primary him"
"I don't understand how the Dem party could endorse a candidate that is anti sanctuary city. That is appalling to me"
"But you have to elect Dems that actually hold those views though..."
"My daughter's school is about 1/3 undocumented"
"If you don't think southern SD by the border is poor, you are beyond clueless."
"They are not in a position to. But we are in a position to demand better"
"One of our biggest fights is protecting the undocumented, and we can't compromise. Sorry"
"You can demand better. Call the VA Dem party, call Northam, show up at his door, do something. I hate how Dems just roll over"
"You're a white guy?"
"Yep. And I give enough of a shit about my neighbors to fight to protect them."
"Don't you dare ever call yourself an ally of the undocumented if you're not willing to demand better from the Dems."
"And PS I live 10 miles from Tijuana in a neighborhood that's largely undocumented. So kindly go fuck yourself"
"I'm concerned about immigrants enough to take a stand when Dems nominate someone who won't protect them. Are you taking a stand?"
"So those that carried torches would vote for Hillary? Says a lot about her and the Dem party"
"I like what you did there"

"Sweetie, I took pictures, so deleting does nothing. Aren't you proud of being the defender of poor, oppressed white people?"
"I called them out for being white and therefore easy for them to not care. I guess that makes me racist"
"It's a group of white people saying it's fine that Northam is adamantly against sanctuary cities."
"Southern white woman calling a black woman racist is a great idea."
"Yep, do it. Like I said. Please do"
"Really, this would be peak liberalism. Do it!"
"I saw your comment. Go for it share how a black woman standing up for the undocumented is racist to a white woman"
"You guys aren't even pretending to not be racist anymore, are you?"
"Compromising!"
"They like the lip service, but don't care too much about comprising the rights of poc if necessary"
"Really, calling a black woman a racist. I love it"
"Are you reverse racisming me? Omg I love liberals"
"Of course, you all are white, and probably of a certain means"
"It's amazing how flat out racism is fine w you guys when it's done by a Dem. You refuse to demand better."
"How did DFA fuck up? By calling a Dem out on their racist views, and not vowing to protect the undocumented?"
"No, if this meant something to you, you would be criticizing him instead of criticizing the people who dare to!"
"I live in San Diego. My kids best friend is undocumented. Spare me."
"I love how some Dems are ok with lesser of two evils, and how dare someone criticize what makes the Dem evil. Just shut up and take it!"
"If the safety of our undocumented population means more to you than just lip service, you would feel the same"
"How did DFA fuck up? By denying to sit back and endorse a guy who won't protect our most vulnerable?"
"Because he doesn't give a shit about brown people"
"Instead of being mad at DFA, how about calling the Northam campaign to voice your displeasure at his stance in sanctuary cities?"
"This is very important for our undocumented brothers and sisters. It's up to us to fight for them to ensure their safety."
"Normal person, normal response https:// twitter.com/jon4vermont/st atus/926314804918276098 …"
"Holy shit, this is so offensive. Straight from Trump's playbook."

"I never realized how much I needed validation from a meat product until today... https:// twitter.com/steak_umm/stat us/926500579815448576 …"
"I make ok money, and honestly, I can barely afford for her to get braces College? Haha! Girl better get a full ride somewhere!"
"Welcome. This pro-life crap makes me so mad. They want me to have the kid, but then take away the means for me to be able to raise her."
"Being pro-life also means giving all Americans the means to afford to raise a child, give them healthcare, and send them to college."
"The republican tax plan is going to cost my middle class family thousands more, and I'm trying to raise a kid and send her to college."
"Seriously, your mental gymnastics here is amazing."
"The $ was intended to stay with state committees. You are making up facts."
"She used money meant for state parties to throw herself Beyoncé concerts. This is both unethical and incompetent."
""Unethically" funneled. I've worked on a state campaign. What she did left them for broke and cost us Dem wins."
"Uhhhh this is not what happened. She took from the state parties coffers, which is like the opposite of helping."
"Now the pressure is really on for me to be my best twitter me"
"Can you follow me? I have all the hot takes"
"Is an antifa humorist like a court jester?"
"You're w Perkins Coie, right?"
"Hey, link to whatever you want but H agreed to fundraise for state parties, then just kept all the $ herself, so...."
"I tend not to engage in sketchy dealings, so.... nope https:// twitter.com/chrislhayes/st atus/926445923374419968 …"
"So she could loot from the victory fund since there was more $ accessible, leaving the stage parties broke"
"If Trump had done the same, they'd be losing their minds."
"HVF $ was supposed to go to state parties. She took it all for herself instead, as there weren't the same contribution limits as Hill4Pres."
"Hope you feel good about voting for an immoral, incompetent candidate who looted from state parties coffers"
"That's not true."
"I've worked on a state campaign. What she did to them was disastrous and most likely ruined the chances for many lower ticket Dems. https:// twitter.com/cd_hooks/statu s/926193604871278592 …"
"Quite a bit. And guess what? He didn't funnel that money into his own campaign"
"Which she had a separate fund for. You're having a hard time with this."
