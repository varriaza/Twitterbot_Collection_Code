"chill out he’s a philly fan he’s just enjoying the game"
"this is a pretty cool stat though and i hate the pats"
"still need to go 6-4 to make playoffs... please god can we not be the bills just once"
"reality is that you have someone with a 4:1 TD-INT ratio (something he can actually control to an extent) without a job."
"put alex smith on the browns and he’s no longer an MVP candidate. TEAM success is not defined by an individual"
"by that logic the top 2 QBs are wentz and smith"
"and you learned them from you basement?"
"lol syracuse football is a joke but that doesn’t take away from the fact that we just beat the #2 team"
"that doesn’t change the fact that you’re salty as fuck not syracuse’s fault that your childhood probably sucked"

"Saint Dino???"
"melo gonna average more points on less shots this year though"
"you have the right to have a gun but banning automatics is not only constitutional but also morally correct"
"should’ve done jeff teague but yup"
"they really put jeff teague and jrue holiday above MELO"
"anything that was paid for doesn’t matter. 100 was stolen. then he spent 70 on something. how could he have taken away more than he stole?"
"okay do y’all really want to talk about history with a yankees fan? how about 27 rings?"

"being a bills, knicks, sabres fan, i guess i’m used to the patience"
"the fact that we went from a team the all around had a ton of heart about 4 years ago, leaves hope that 4 years from now, we could go back"
"how you not gonna look at the adjective form though"
"and you’re not gonna include what they lost? okay"
"this is a fact. how can you argue otherwise when there are literal facts going against you? i do not understand what i can possibly say"
"in countries without birth control, there are more pregnancies and more abortions, even unsafe abortions"
"but proof is not enough to convince you otherwise"
"i didn’t. just tends to be an american problem. not only americans"
"and when someone disagrees w you, they’re wrong automatically. i was willing to listen to you but you have no proof to back up your claims"
"major problem w america is that people would rather listen to their own logic than actual science/statistics"
"i have statistics proving that birth stats would go down... you’re using flawed logic."
"when you know you’re wrong and the other guy brings up stats proving it but you’re stubborn pic.twitter.com/WGSNpiwQxR"
"not if you’re trying to decrease a fixed number. we’re literally talking about lowering abortion stats and you’re not using stats"
"and if you never have stats to back up your points, you are wrong."
"it would increase sex and decrease births more. do you really think the AVERAGE PERSON was a virgin, found birth control, and fucked 50 guys"
"you are deluded. people don’t have sex on average 50x more because they have birth control"
"not at that high rates and that’s a fact. also would extremely lower rape babies"
"birth control has a 98% success rate so unless people started have sex at absurdly higher rates (almost 50x more) it would lower abortions"
"wrong it has proven to prevent more. don’t just say random shit"
"can someone tell me why this is funny"
"still 12 players from each conference so it’s still fucked. it can only be completely fixed when Dame can make it over Lowry"
"so y’all get your news from ISIS now?"
"disagree with this. they have been posting about the victims for a whole day, look at their TL. This definitely deserves an article"
"not really though. it’s quite literally called what it is. don’t complain about someone that’s labeled properly, complain about dylan roof"
"mass shooters are worse than terrorists.. mass shooters motivation is to kill. i don’t understand why we want to call him a terrorist so bad"
"i don’t understand what the need is to call him something we don’t know he is. he is a sick disgusting human but we dont know his motivation"
"because we don’t know motivation yet. i’m as upset as everyone else but i don’t understand the need to call it something we don’t know it is"
"because it could be someone who decided to shoot people up due to a personal problem (wife left, etc). people seem almost excited about this"
"not that they’re passing but ingram is better"
"most buzzer beaters is a pointless stat? okay dude"
"if blake griffin joined the warriors he would have gotten the same hate. you’re talking about less than half of the reason"
"pic.twitter.com/s8tjfRzG8T"
"so if AD (before boogie) joined the warriors, it wouldn’t have been a weak move?"
"that’s certainly not the only reason why, just one minor reason. the main crime is joining a team that would have gone to the finals w/o him"
"but then KD shouldn’t get hate for the same logic."
"Wade just made the weakest move since KD and it’s getting no hate wtf is wrong with NBA fans"
"there are other charities out there... you don’t donate all of you money to one cause, instead use your name to get other people to donate"
"you’re the type of person to not donate a penny. trying to find a reason to hate"
"trump is not a good christian. didn’t donate to 9/11 victims. promised “personal” money to houston, instead will use other people’s money."
"they should have free food, free tuition, and the ability to make money off of their name. they don’t need salaries though. it’s that simple"
