"There needs to be action from the system & laws and the dismantling of agencies supporting of pedophiles.Even in ill bought ‘entertainment’."
"Had a relative go for auditions in CA years ago who was noticed and nearly raped on several. Scarred her and she was not able to process it."
"Then there was conflict about retroactively ranking certain sex offense misdemeanors not expunged as felonies."
"Realize that was the law. Made by pedos for pedos.After it became felony to rape an adult it was not a felony to rape a child til about ‘74."
"— which they said the rapist couldn’t resist, therefore making the victim the aggressor. I remember him buckling and crying on the floor."
"I was forced to sit in court to watch a four year old boy harrassed by the judge because the rapist said the child ‘wiggled his ass’ —"
"So if two men raped a child only the first was chargeable. He could cast doubt by saying he didn’t know the child was inexperienced."
"At one point in PA the law said only the first person raping a child did what was termed ‘permanent damage’ & chargeable. Not even a felony."
"I was abused at home and molested by ‘authority figures’ as a child, partly for being ethnically impure and defective. Laws support pedos."
"When I saw she ran a competition I almost gagged. Because that is how many of them ‘get there’. It’s who you do more than who you know."
"When I approached an interested agency owner openly told me the ‘only way’ was - sex with patrons, sex with other models, or sex with her."
"I was scouted to model by a prestige agency who stapled little bags of cocaine to back of business cards. Reported. Investigated 20y later."
