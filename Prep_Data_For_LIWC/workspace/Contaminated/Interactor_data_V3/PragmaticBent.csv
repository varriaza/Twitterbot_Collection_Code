PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 23:40;0;1;"Believe as many things that are true, and as few things that are false, as I can. It means understanding the difference.";;;;"926594844188921857";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926594844188921857
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 23:32;0;0;"Well, yeah. Those are places where Catholic missionaries are preaching against condom use and abortion. Proselytizing their bullshit.";;;;"926592904121978881";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926592904121978881
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 23:27;0;0;"And what makes you think that's not exactly what those clergy thought they were doing?? You simply don't understand how faith works. Your pic.twitter.com/7TbSPdk7BQ";;;;"926591769281691648";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926591769281691648

PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 23:12;0;1;"Well, I don't know about "open arms". Personally, I'll be keeping him at arm's length.";;;;"926587890422992896";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926587890422992896
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 23:11;0;0;"LOL. Hocus pokus. You don't even understand what that means, much less why he was called "Son of Man". There were many before him.";;;;"926587593512321024";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926587593512321024

PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:50;0;1;"Well, Japan isn't really a fair comparison. People are killed by sword-wielding ninjas in Japan. Nobody needs a gun.";;;;"926582472711778304";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926582472711778304
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:47;0;1;"Oh, of course not. We should be laughing in their faces as we point out how ridiculous their claims are. pic.twitter.com/IE2kGxr5cW";;;;"926581704730513408";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926581704730513408
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:44;0;0;"You don't know "what Jesus would do". You think you know more than all the clergy who condemned Giordono Bruno knew? You're an arrogant ass.";;;;"926580766074654722";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926580766074654722

PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:34;0;1;"Actually, I think the zeitgeist is changing a helluva lot faster than we had a reasonable expectation it would 20 yrs ago. Shouldn't be long";;;;"926578394619432960";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926578394619432960
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:24;0;1;"Well, it isn't necessary, logically. Also, think about what the Universe is constantly expanding into. Can't be "nothing", right?";;;;"926575749842309121";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926575749842309121
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:21;0;0;"Yeah, that wasn't what I said. I said believing in resurrections, magic births, flood myths, et al, w/o evidence is insanity. There's a big pic.twitter.com/CJKLYplvwb";;;;"926575127583756288";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926575127583756288
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:16;0;0;"No, just belief in the somethings that religions claim without evidence is insanity. Like resurrections, healing by laying on hands, etc.";;;;"926573842583179264";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926573842583179264

PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:12;0;1;"Yeah, too bad that the only evidence we've found after 2000 years points to the vast majority of bible claims being false.";;;;"926572933694320641";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926572933694320641
PragmaticBent;2017-11-03 22:11;0;1;"Bullshit. That's an oft misused, highly situational axiom. There are far more cases where that isn't true. Especially as concerns faith.";;;;"926572682509996032";https://twitter.com/PragmaticBent/status/926572682509996032
