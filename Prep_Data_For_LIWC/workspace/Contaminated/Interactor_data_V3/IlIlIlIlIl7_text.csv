"What do you think the sentence should have been?"
"In Corey Stewart's America, its mandatory!"
"Are you white? It's not on the campaign application but it's a key factor in the process."
"I've set him out on the curb with the rest of the old junk to be recycled but he keeps trying to get back in. You'll have to come get him."
"I don't think you understood his point. Which is part of his point."
"So you believe the federal government is in error in restricting the access of the citizenry to surface to air missiles?"
"Good to know. For future interactions, I will assume you do not understand any abstract concepts."
"What is your position on the confederacy?"
"Maybe he could go ruin your state then?"
"Speaking of incompetence, did you know Corey stewart was fired from the trump campaign for incompetence and insubordination?"
"Speaking of fraud without principles, what do you think of Corey Stewart's mosque vote?"
"Uhh, when the guy holding the confederate flag is a candidate, then maybe the race issue gets some play."
"Did they kick him out for his betrayal last year?"
"By "us" you mean white people, right? Corey stewart sure isn't interested in defending non white people."
"Ill downscale the analogy to take into account your failure of imagination."
"How about a home defense surface to air missile launcher? Do you think that's a good armament to have?"
"So the short answer is that no, you do not want to bet on it. You think he's going to lose."
"Sounds like you aren't very confident if you are already complaining about the loss."
"Aren't you the one who claims they don't get the point? I get your points perhaps better than you do."
"So you feel like it would ok for YOU to own a personal home defense nuke because you feel comfortable making your own choices?"
"I'm a student doing a project on Corey stewart. I'm looking for black supporters of Corey stewart. Do you know any?"
"Everything went downhill when they took Jupiter out of the public schools."
"Lisa, as a student and fan of history, I know I can count on you. I need a place to put my 30 foot tall statue of Hitler. Your front yard?"
"How much did you donate?"
"When did you flee the left?"
"Ohoho, look who is suddenly in favor of government oversight of my home defense nuclear arms. When did you turn so liberal?"
"Ah well, I was hoping."
"Right, I managed to deduce that. But how confident are you? Are you willing to bet on it?"
"Quick, without mentioning the war to own human beings, name something Robert lee or Jeb Stuart did worthy of a monument."
"Statues. His platform is statues."
"So you think the problem with nukes and Ebola is that they are simply too dangerous to own? That someone might... get hurt? Or killed?"
"Right, but is there anything to indicate a connection to manaforts crime?"
"What makes you say that?"
"If it's a straw man, what's the fallacy? Go on. Spell it out."
"But a number, please."
"Could you be clear on just how many guns you think America needs?"
"Would you care to bet that Tim Kaine will lose to Corey stewart?"
"Yeah, who wants to go to a church that wants people to feel welcome? That's not what Jesus fouls have wanted!"
"You must be one of those Russian bots."
"Not really. Corey stewart will probably lose that primary too."
"You mean trump, right?"
"What is your preferred fascist vehicle maker?"
"So true. Why would you vote for Corey stewart who couldn't even win a primary?"
"Have you checked Corey Stewart's truck for DNA?"
"Not really. His positions are bad for Virginia. Pick an issue, and I'll show how Corey stewart will be bad for you."
"Care to bet on it?"
"Do you think anyone that accuses others of doing things that they themselves have done is a bad leader?"
"Which tweet did Corey stewart delete?"
"You think America needs less guns? Finally we are reaching some common ground."
"I think the problem is that you don't want to understand the point I am clearly making. Try answering the question about Ebola vs nukes."
"I think you do."
"Do you have any examples from this century?"
"People die, and Corey stewart says nothing. Citizens need help and Corey stewart says nothing. But if a confederate statue is moved..."
"People die, and Corey stewart says nothing. Citizens need help and Corey stewart says nothing. But if a confederate statue is moved..."
"I've been trying to find a place for my 30 foot tall statue of Hitler and bin Ladin. I assume you are ok with your front yard?"
"People die, and Corey stewart says nothing. Citizens need help and Corey stewart says nothing. But if a confederate statue needs a hand..."
"Which part don't you understand? Do you know who Pol Pot was?"
"So true. Leaders need to be accountable for the actions of those under them- or else what are they doing?"
"Who wasn't?"
"Could you just refresh my memory and tell me what political party David duke, Richard Spencer and Jason kessler belong to?"
"Have you tried not being racist?"
"The higher the Christian population in your nation, the more potential mass shooters you have?"
"Which animals must be erased? People that belong to religions that commit mass murder?"
"What's it like, being a racist? Is it nice? It must be so blissful."
"So when you said "all the hate is on the left", you actually meant "well, a whole lot of hate is on the right when you think about it.""
"Yo, can I get some drugs?"
"Do you know of any monuments that have been torn down? Again, be specific."
"Ok, but which ones? Or do you just mean "the idea of southern monuments in general"?"
"Which monuments do you mean? Be specific."
"They didn't leave the union. The rebellion was crushed."
"But Corey stewart... What did Virginia do to you that you need such terrible revenge?"
"Honored? For what? Rebellion?"
"Would you like a statue to them?"
"What's with the odd grammatical construct of "ever who"?"
"Also slavery. You forgot that part."
"Oh man, it must be tough balancing at the top of that slippery slope fallacy."
"Right about what? Be specific."
"You feel threatened by demographic data?"
"Why do you hate Virginia? What did they do to you?"
"It's not like you just throw away a line like that. He paid those out of state campaigners good money."
"Corey stewart and trump hate each other. They will never work together. That's why no endorsement."
"You don't consider the kkk or Nazis hateful?"
"I know. Nothing but whistling all day and all night. Drives them crazy."
"We need to ban shakira!"
"You don't think people should be able to buy Ebola? Why not? Why do you think it is worse than nuclear weapons for home defense?"
"Says the guy arguing we need more guns in the wake of the most horrific mass shooting in our nations history."
"Buy me a drink, yes. This guy gets it."
"Prediction: Nixon will be totally fine, watergate just another dem witch hunt."
"Ah yes, I should have known that manafort was secretly a democratic plant. It's so obvious."
"A right not exercised is a right abandoned. If you don't buy me a gun then you forfeit the 2nd amendment."
"Ah, a man after my own heart. I've been trying to buy nuclear missiles and Ebola but the stupid government won't let me."
"America forgot about peral harbor which is why God has cursed us and turned his eyes away from us. Only when we return to that can we live"
"Why do you want people other than good guys to have guns?"
"What? You want to arm criminals?"
"That finely honed intellect at work."
"Listen to this man. Lots of experience with acne."
"You prefer Corey stewart who isn't an elite idiot?"
"But Corey stewart is the swamp. Look at his donor list."
"Do you think it was coincidence he scheduled it on the same day as the NAACP event?"
"Best friends stewart and Kessler? pic.twitter.com/fGmnDPlJNz"
"Did Corey Stewart show you his collection of confederate statues he's personally rescued?"
"In other news, water continues to be wet."
"Have you asked why trump never endorsed stewart? It's because they hate each other."
"Now you cosplay as a Jew?"
"Can't you masturbate to someone else?"
"Yeah, let's go back to your cosplay choices. How often do you tell people you are a special forces sniper? Or a marine recon ranger?"
"Which shitty meme will you spend 15 minutes selecting now?"
"Yes, that's the most predictable thing you could say. I forgot your assistance ends after 530 and you have to write on your own."
"Maybe I will. Maybe I'll go to your tiny building gym so you can stop worrying about who the strongest person is."
"Small building."
"They are gonna kick you out of your gym when they catch you going through people's stuff. Probably get a well deserved beating too"
"Oh, this is just some retarded act? You saw MASH and are trying to leave the service? Scared to be deployed under a trump administration?"
"Surely you meant OCS. Did you forget you were cosplaying as an army man and not navy?"
"Someone find a Nazi heritage site, see how he reacts."
"Oh? Which European nation were you kicked out of?"
"Well, I originally thought that confederate monument supporters WERE racist dirtbags, but your tweet convinced me otherwise."
"Excellent. I always knew you confederate statue guys can be counted on to support Hitler statues."
"So I'm sure you could tell me what the name of the army social media policy is...? Since you paid so much attention?"
"How do you know who the cucks are?"
"Imagine how much he's going to lose this time?! He's going to keep on increasing that lose margin- maybe even lose the presidency!"
"Are black people allowed to attend?"
"Why would you support Corey stewart?"
"Why would you support Corey stewart?"
"Have you read the policies on this?"
"Did Gillespie ever describe his support for the confederacy as the "worsttjing he's ever done"?"
"Why not both? Are you willing to take this tweet to both groups and see what they say?"
"As a fan of history, can I put up a statue to adolf Hitler in your yard, please?"
"So you think it's ok to have a statue of Hitler if you were related to him? Is that your position?"
"Why? Don't you have a rep to take those questions to? You should. You know your EO rep in the g1 don't you?"
"Whooosh. Did you hear that? No, I expect not. It went so far over your head that i doubt you noticed at all."
"You certainly never attended any of the mandatory training. Did you go to one rotc meeting and decide to upgrade yourself?"
"It's posts like this that show why you are not and could never be an army officer. Such a display of low class behavior."
"Can I get a statue of bin Ladin in your yard? You probably forgot about him since he doesn't have a statue."
"We can't forget our history. We need statues of Hitler. You probably already forgot him."
"Let's just run through the nonsense filters. Is climate change an illusion? How about chemtrails? Was the holocaust real?"
"Did your one black friend tell you that so it must be true?"
"Are you "abusing" quotes or do you have "an" odd grammatical point "to" make?"
"Can you "read" the "inscription" on the "monument"? """
"Can I count on your support to erect a 30 foot tall statue of Hitler?"
"I need to erect a 30 foot tall statue of Hitler
