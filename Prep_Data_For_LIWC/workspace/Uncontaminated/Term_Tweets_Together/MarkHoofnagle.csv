MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:56;0;0;"Ah. The myth of the fence sitter. It might just be possible that people that study scicomm have thought of that. And no. It's tribal war.";;;;"926599021686329344";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926599021686329344
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:55;0;0;"This is an ideological war in itself, faith in debate. The data, the science of scicomm, does not support it's efficacy as intervention.";;;;"926598786398539778";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926598786398539778
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:54;0;0;"Debate doesn't change minds, nor does education, nor does information. It signals your tribe. The problem is more complex than "just facts"";;;;"926598572589682688";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926598572589682688
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:52;0;0;"The reaction is denialism, every time. It's wonderful to be idealistic about ideas and debate, but we can't fool ourselves.";;;;"926597882202947586";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926597882202947586
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:51;0;0;"Tell someone the basis of their job is flawed, ask them to accept an idea that invalidates their choices in life. It happens. It fails.";;;;"926597700111491075";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926597700111491075
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:50;0;0;"Further, often the idea is the person. People's ideology is existential. Their lives, careers, beliefs are tied up in ideas.";;;;"926597504468217856";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926597504468217856
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:48;0;0;"And sadly, that's most ideological debate. This sounds very nice, but inconsistent with what we know about scicomm. Debate is overvalued.";;;;"926596921015324672";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926596921015324672
MarkHoofnagle;2017-11-03 23:46;0;1;"This presumes honest debate. What about when one party lies? Or is a pseudoscientist? Sometimes you must switch to pointing out deception.";;;;"926596536133455872";https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/926596536133455872
