"Correct me if im wrong but the credits on the songwriting are only jack antonoff taylor and another. Performers are zayn and taylor."
"Twas originally a song written by jack antonoff and another (i forget) for zayn to sing. They then asked taylor to co write and sing."
"I get it. Im just saying the manager used a wrong example."
"I know. Im not easily offended. Swifties can be brutal too but that was just so..."

"Justin bieber is the king!"
"Why 2?"
"Taylor gets help from producers too."
"Yes. There is nothing wrong with having someone write ur music. Most performers use songs written by someone else."
"There are different types of artists. Some perform some write. Im just saying taylor cant be used as his example bec she writes her songs"
"Maybe you don't much about taylor but she is a singer-songwriter. She was inducted to the country songwriters hall of fame in her early 20s"
"Uhhmmm taylor either writes her songs by herself or co-writes. There's nothing wrong with not writing ur own but he used wrong example."
"I know but they cant seem to distinguish harmless snarks from real offensive tweets. I read ur tweets even abt taylor and i laugh."
"They will regret being this offensive. They want their bts to go global but they offend other fandoms."
"They are smut sites and writers. The real ones only have praises for taytay."
"They don't even listen to her songs."
"Imagine after amas"
"It's track 15."
"Yeah that was my first reaction too"
"Omg! Lol what the hell!"
"Well, she is bothered by our queen. Pity her. Tsk tsk."
"I think as a solo artist vis a vis 5th harmony"
"Congratulations!"
"There are 2 #CallItWantYouWant on itunes. I already had one as pre-order and decided to download another. Why? I'm crazy."
"Please don't say "ended" we love empress riri"
"I can't believe i am still listening to #CallItWantYouWant ."
"Congratulations to your girl!"
"Some people are really easily triggered arent they? I feel bad for her she is just funny."
"How did she get dragged into that?"
"Omg"
"Congratulations!"
"No prob"
"It includes itunes and all other sources"
"Not just target. Including all sources."
"Where did that figure come from?"
"The power of a fandom"
"That is why all too well is a swiftie fave"
"My fave katy perry is the one that got away. And it's not the top katy song. I hate roar and yet everyone loves it."
"Every person relates differently."
"Ready for it and CIWYW same level then LWYMMD and Gorgy same level."
"I am biased. I love all 4 but this the one i really can't stop listening to. And it connects."
"Who is that guy whispering in the background?"
"Most swifties already pre ordered the album"
"Every person relates to the song that means something to them. I actually love all 4."
"Ummm she actually said she didnt need to be saved. It's a bittersweet song. Combination strength and weakness."
"The 4 songs so far are each unique but they all feel like they belonv together. When you listen to all 4 simultaneously you get the thread."
"I love all 4 songs. They are unique and yet they feel part of a whole. You have to listen with open heart and mind."
"The part about making the same mistakes and burning bridges, never learning...hits me straight to the heart everytime."
"It's still there, annoying as ever"
"I had the same question. I got lectured about pop culture."
"Like...they are forever ever ever getting back together..."
"I listened to his album but not my cup of tea. I liked one song though. But i forget now which one."
"Lol! Is that sheeran? It's one of taylor's faves."
"Taylor is clearly giving a totally different sound and experience with reputation. We owe her an open mind without preconceived notions."
"Swifties, remember that taylor doesn't look back when it comes to music. Don't expect another Red, speak now, fearless, or even 1989."
"I love all 3. I have to listen to all 3 all the time."
"The font is 1989"
"People presume it's a ballad. But the piano from abc ad is for thr nov 9 performance"
"Woah @Rosalinde_A https:// twitter.com/samsmithworld/ status/926116155835772928 â¦"

"https:// twitter.com/i/moments/9258 59250127060992 â¦"
"Altho she is marketing reputation thru 3rd parties there is no visible presence of taytay on tv radio and other media, for now."
"Taytay's singles from reputation are performing better than singles fr 1989. The difference is she was everywhere in 2014 and promonwas huge"
"An effort to understand the stan phenomenon. Most media do not even try. I'm glad nothing is about the swifties. We would come out crazy."
"Direct TV is so tied to Taylor. I wonder how much they paid her. https:// twitter.com/TSwiftNZ/statu s/925824381439303680 â¦"

"Her exes, to name a few."
"Ok i get it now. Thank you."
"At&t is suffering huge losses that's why the push with direct tv."
"They cant. At&t is purely an american firm."
"Katy had a very successful concert in TO last night. Saw a lot of tweets sayin twas amazing. Sincerely happy for her."
"Ok. If taylor collabs with luis fonsi would there be a negative reaction? Im just curious and tryin to understand the matter."
"She is tied to her contract with at&t. I hope she signs a contract with an intl product like so intl swifties have access."
"It's like appropriation except she is collabing with a latin artist instead of just using latin music by herself. Am i right?"
"She said i her interview she picks out the lines fr stuff she writes every now and then when inspired."
"Taylor writes lyrics all the time. She then uses lyrics fr different situations to write one song. So a song is not necessarily abt one"
"I understand. Thanks"
"It's just a song not a biography. For all you know she wrote it about a one night stand"
"Tease..."
"Can i ask why? Dont know backstory about this"
"I never thought this would ever happen. Is there a chance for taytay and _________? https:// twitter.com/PopCrave/statu s/925806072258015233 â¦"
"The backlash will be worse than the drama fr ss."
"Lol...most of the accounts i follow. I even follow fans of katy beyonce and lady gaga. I steer clear of hate but sometimes i do butt in."
"A lot are actually."
"The old testament, yes. The New Testament part of the bible which only christians accept is totally different. It speaks only of love."
"It's more like she is not everywhere. With 1989 she was on tv covers radio social media. That's why they say she is underperforming."
"@PPistone The National Anthem at the truck race was a 10! That's the way it's sung."

"peterson is a rather new exception. sargon and thunderfoot are viewer-supported."
"A valid criticism. my approach is often to broaden the model such that the exception falls inside it. But as someone who studies physics mistaking the map for the terrain is kind of my job."
"I think that is overated. especially with the republicans who are traditionalist. rather, they didn't have any charismatic candidates. hell having 20 of them is always bad news."
"I can only use black and white definitions but then again I make them so specific to get my Riemann sum."
"eehm... we were arguing anti-feminism =/= flat earthers. not feminism =/= flat earthers. and most large anti-feministy channels aren't upper class or backed by big donors. . for the record I'm not an anti-feminist because I know it's a couple of rich bad apples spoiling the bunch"
"semantics! yay. . also me surprisingly enough not being blocked. . but honestly, the mainstream definitions of sex and gender are trashy generalisations. way to broad. more detail is needed. hell, I can think up three different definitions of sex alone."
"*inherent gender identity. twitter needs an edit button"
"1. no but yes, it has a positive effect on the general state of mind because it makes the sex conform to the gender identity. 2. yes, that was never in dispute."
"pretty much indeed."
"Maybe not on the internet but in traditional media it's all about connections which most people don't have."
"No, I'm using a myriad of definitions. what you are talking about is not my definition of perceived gender identity but rather gender and inherent gender identity. . gender=cause inherent gender identity=effect perceived gender identity=what it looks like to an outsider."
"Depends on the medium. twitter is shit. but with hatemail a respectful though stern response may actually startle people and open them up."
"yes. but that is inherent gender identity. what you feel like. not percieved gender identity, what you look like."
"No one should but someone will have to if we ever want to solve this issue."
"most people talk against neo-nazis. not with them. also, to really affect someone who's in this deep real life contact is probably needed."
"Of course. but most people are less difficult to talk to. so more tolerance will be needed."
"good, then because gender is not sex and especially perceived gender identity is a social construct e.g. high heels. I'd argue these two are not directly related. which is why surgery has little to do with your perceived though a lot to do with your inherent gender identity"
"yeah. But I don't think either of us is average. For me though improvement is all about searching there the blockades are."
"You should treat them with at least some respect because that is the only way to get them to respect you, open up and break their bubble."
"Okay, then do you believe that the surgery changes both your sex and your gender or only your sex?"
"Yes but it's the rich ones that have access to the megaphones and thus get in the public view."
"I don't doubt that. But you have searched. Many people don't."
"Do you agree that 1. the surgery changes your sex and that 2. in principle with enough work everyone can pass as any gender?"
"especially love nazis because a lack of compassion is how the radicalised in the first place. hating nazis only keeps them trapped."
"you can't deny that most people who study at harvard aren't upper-class the tuition only forces them to be."
"which is then based on your gender which is how your brain is wired but may not be the same as your personal gender identity because people suck at knowing themselves."
"perceived gender identity is my term for how masculine and feminine you look and. transition surgery has little to do with it. that's just changing your sex to fit your own personal gender identity which is how you feel."
"what punk and post punk are we talking about?I mean, most punk was utter shite because good music was too much effort."
"eehm... where did I imply you did?"
"I actually do because feminism is even now with all the pr damage still a very strong and useful concept which should be retaken by sensible people... ... NO! NOT THE PROLETARIAT!... ... okay, maybe the proletariat... but only with a marketplace of ideas 
"Aren't we all. I'm an utter perfectionist who can only think black and white, which is good for your self esteem btw, so I have to work around my limitations."
"the earth can be factually proven to be not flat. feminism is a vague mix of activism and social science mixed with a large bucket of upper-class elitism. there's a lot to criticise."
"*I don't believe gender is assigned but rather inherent in a person so the whole Idea of assigned gender is bullshit to me. now If we were talking about perceived gender identity. that is possible to change but you don't need surgery to change that."
"I'm afraid of damaging objects which includes humans. a sex change/gender reassignment surgery* is as abhorrent as a tattoo or writing in a book. ergo it's utterly abominable. . Have I ever said I'm fucked in the brain?"
"yay feminism?..."
"you are using arguments that have been seriously made. yeah, internet discourse sucks..."
"well... that's plain and simple nonsense..."
"eeh... that's mostly the liberal elite. sane liberals still want to have bush&bush in prison."
"the irony is that in the classic d&d table good is on the left..."
"actually you deserve nothing but then again letting people die isn't a lot of fun either."
"it doesn't, you can have a situation where everybody is self-employed. but neither does socialism so his argument is still trash."
"eh... anything to get attention in today's sea of information and advertisement."
"... come on. I'm a literal transphobe and I'm less of a dick about it."
"it's fairly easy to legalise. "don't slow down stuff". you can check it and there is a higher authority with a big stick. the problem with peace is that the judges are on the same level as the actors."
"NO! nonononononononoNO! the whole "but they do it" mentality is how we got in this dickswabbeling festival of excrement extraordinaire in the first place!"
"Tim's? I'm afraid my knowledge of tla's and is limited."
"I'm not saying you are saying that 
"yeah but then trump had the political approach of a literal cabbage and ended up just letting the people behind him decide."
"clearly not. the CIA does illegal thing which is illegal and the us doesn't do illegal things so the CIA is not American unless it's not doing illegal things in which case it clearly is because patriotism."
"meh, better to go out and kill a trainful of people as well as possibly your players."
"you think it did? seems quite business as usually to me..."
"I live in the Netherlands, we have proportional representation and relatively low corruption. I recognise the situation in the us is pretty much a oligarchy."
"My view on the government is probably different because ours isn't very corrupt. but yeah, the us needs some... modifications."
"please don't use rightists. one side being arseholes by acting like all of a political side is the same is enough."
"that assumes memeing is inherently positive when it's often usless or even destructive. also, nothing wrong with centrists. at least you can talk with them."
"you mean a government with adequate oversight? yeah... though I'd say that if we fix incentive problems there wouldn't that massive an issue."
"welcome, Could I have a conversation about the value of nationalising infrastructure 
"it's true though. meming is based on the idea that nothing is important. once you get strong views you become stale and repetetive."
"don't worry. it's from above the rivers so it doesn't matter in any case."
"yeah, only the centre can because to be able to meme you need to not give to many fucks."
"I don't have a lot of hubris but I am extremely egocentric. that's also fun to work around."
"... it's not even Dutch :s It's a dialect from twente"
"to be honest, it kinda does. I've got my fair share of massive self esteem issues. but yeah, at least it keeps my ego in check :)"

"Heavenly Father take control of November. Protect my loved ones"
"So glad to see the back of October."
"He nodded, "I remember everything. I remember being torn in two by three beautiful children." He smiled."
""What do you mean?" He kept stroking his hair gently."
""Are you okay big guy?" He asked softly and slowly weakly reached up to stroke his hair."
"He woke up hours later and looked at Carlos, "hi." He lightly said."
"There were screws in his jaw and temples forcing it in and it was as painful as it looked."
"The stitches came off easily, the headset forcing a grin wouldn't be so easy."
"He did as told and breathed in the anesthetic. Soon passing out."
"He nodded and sniffled, gripping him tightly, "I love you.""
"He clutched him hard and walked with him out of the room. Sobbing lightly, "it hurts so much.""
"He gripped him trembling hard, "it hurts." He whispered and clutched his labcoat."
""Get it off!" He was hyperventilating, "get it off!""
"Everything came back and he collapsed forward. His eyes rolling back as he tried to claw the contraption off his head, sobbing."
"Bloody tears started to run down his cheeks as he inadvertently leaned to the touch."
"He looked dizzy and nauseous. "y-Y-you look familiar...""
""Carlos. Are you sure of all of this?""
"His third eye twitched and he winced, "y-you must be incorrect." He whispered."
"He watched the video curiously and tilted his head, "wh-?" He was so confused."
""Hm? My eye has always been like this!" He stared at Carlos for a long time. His birthmarks were gray and still and his ring was missing."
"The forced grin seemed painful, "oh! Steve must have finally left! Good for you she is a catch!" His third eye was sown shut."
"He turned to Carlos and there was a trap on his head forcing him to grin. "I wish stranger but I'd remember someone wanting to marry me.""
"The voice led him all the way to Cecils studio, into the recording booth. "Oh! What a surprise listeners! The stranger is here!""
""There's a stranger in town today. Who is he? Why is his hair perfect and beautiful?" It sounded like his first episode."
"@nv_science"
"Cecils reeducation made him forget everything about his life aside from his job and personality. He couldn't remember his husband not kids. pic.twitter.com/ADbxpvnfUz"
""KEVIN!! PROTECT YOUR GOD CHILDREN!" He thrashed and was starting to get dragged away."
"He moaned softly and eventually came onto his lower stomach. "I love you.""
""I love you~ my life mate." He whispered and kissed him."
""Step aside Kevin Diego has ordered his reeducation." One of the guards said through a grin. "PROTECT MY KIDS! GET TO CARLOS!" @nv_science"
""Don't rebel against them. Why are you-" suddenly grinning guards burst in and grabbed Cecil."
""You're so good~" he moved his gups up and down with Carlos's thrust."
""I love you!~" he panted as he reached to rub his own cock."
"He frowned and hugged him tight, "I like you like this." He cuddled against him. (Cecil gets taken my a resurrected StrexCorp and reeducated"
""It's too good baby!~" he was quivering and blushing deeply, "you're so good at being my mate~""
""There was a time that I hated you but how can I hate someone so kind?" (Ooh I have a dramatic idea.)"
""Oh god Carlos!~" clawing at the sheets and quivering, "I love you!""
"He smiled and ruffled Kevins hair, "my twin eh?""
"He smiled softly and nuzzled his shoulder, "me too buddy.""
""All of that is past us.""
"*him"
"He tilted his head, "you've never been hugged before?" He looked up at you."
"He moaned and wrapped his legs around his hips."
""The thing is... It almost killed me and my cat." He looked down and hugged him."
""Oh gosh Carlos! Take me! Please!""
""Don't apologize Kevin. Just maybe don't give anymore StrexPets."
"He blushed and panted, "take me baby.""
"He backed up a bit, "because you were very nice and more like me.""
"He fell back against the bed and panted, blushing deeply, "golly gosh.""
""I wish Strex wasn't here. I'm sorry but I would've liked to meet you before Diego.""
"He let out a loud moan and soon came into his mouth."
"His eyes widened and he squirmed uncomfortably, "Kevin? Do you remember that time I talked to you over the radio before strex happened?""
"His back arched hard and squealed, "Carlos!~ I'm gonna cum!~""
"He nodded, "understandable. Just please tell Diego to change his scent. It's unfortunately attractive to me when I'm in heat.""
""Oh my god Carlos!~" he laced his fingers into his perfect hair."
""J-just curious." He was still in heat but minorly."
""Have you ever wanted to sleep with me?""
""At the station.""
"He nodded and rubbed the back of his neck."
""He made me go into heat.. I feel bad that Carlos had to witness that." He seemed creeped out by the civility that they were holding."
"He gasped suddenly and leaned back, clutching the sheets. "C-Carlos!~""
"He nodded, "he came back apologizing about all that happened during the revolution." He smiled and held the child close."
""Kev Diego tried to seduce me.""
"He did as told and slowly shut his eyes."
""Carlos, earl won't hurt us." He softly said and smiled softly, "he's been taking care of me during my pregnancy. Kevin has been so nice too"
""It's too good!~" he squeaked."
"earl glared back but did as told slowly setting Cecil down on the hood of the car so he can be involved, "guys can we not fight?""
"Bully sucks more than Nancy but Nancy is still a mean cunt."
"He moaned a whiny girly moan and panted, moving his hips to the touch, "y-you can~""
""H-hey.." He lightly mumbled and his eyes widened, "oh my god. Cecil had the children!" He rushed to Cecils side and swooped him up."
"He gasped and moaned, bucking into his hand, "c-Carlos~!""
"-and the babies."
"As soon as they got home he texted earl. Earl exited the house in his chefs coat and boxers and his eyes widened when he saw Cecil, Carlos -"
"He blushed deeply and arched to the kisses. "Oh gosh~" his eyes changed color to an amethyst purple."
"He grabbed his hand, "I'm so sorry... Take me home and I'll explain everything to earl.""
"His back arched and he moaned, his hips receptive to the touch. "C-Carlos~""
""I'm sorry Carlos.. I needed someone to hold me when I thought you were dead... Earl was there.. WE NEVER SLEPT TOGETHER THOUGH I SWEAR.""
"He moaned and squirmed lightly. Whining cutely, "oh fuck carlos~" he moved so Carlos was on top of him."
"He nodded sadly and sighed, looking down sadly. He looked very ashamed."
"He gasped lightly and squirmed beneath him gently."
"- glanced over worriedly."
""It's alright Carlos. I'm just freaked out because we sorta had a funeral for you... And earl took over as the man of the house." He -"
"He nodded and panted, "yes~ my pheromones are extra strong around my mate~""
""You had been gone for 16 months.." He sighed, "I was so worried.""
"A new scent seemed to fill the room. It smelled of cherry, pomegranate, and honey. His birthmarks were thrashing excitedly."
"He gasped lightly and moaned in his ear, his purple eyes seeming to sparkle."
""Yes." He nodded before slowly putting the two in the their car seats. He took the next child and started to breastfeed him."
""I need you to bite here really hard." He pointed to the corner of his neck."
""Yes and no. I like being fucked." He whispered and purred, "I don't want to force you to do anything but I need more~""
"He panted and rubbed against his crotch, "I'm n-not usually at all dominant even if I'm taking a member." He whispered and blushed."
"The children had beautiful little birthmarks all their own that were squirming as they fed."
""I've gone into heat because of that filthy double or yours." He whispered and panted. Suddenly biting his shoulder hard."
"His heat was setting in place so he purred, straddling his waist, biting at his neck all over."
"He nodded and started to breastfeed the children, he didn't have breasts but he did have a lactation gland."
"He suddenly bit his neck, digging his nails into Carlos's chest."
"He nodded and softly said, "I'll take two of the children, I have to feed them anyways.""
""That was so good~" he whispered and curled up to his chest."
"He nodded, "you'll have to carry me~""
"He collapsed into the sheets panting hard, "mmh Carlos~""
""I love you more big guy~" he whispered softly."
"His eyes rolled back and he soon came into the sheets, his toes curling and his legs trembling."
""Me neither." He grinned and leaned into his chest and nuzzled his shoulder, "I'm in love with you~""
""Me too Carlos!~" he spread his legs wider, "I'm so close!~ I love you!~""
""You're so handsome." He whispered and kissed him again, "and you're my handsome fiancÃ©.""
"He moaned louder and clawed at the sheets, "oh fuck Carlos!~""
"He rolled his eyes, "you're a bigger dork." He giggled and leaned up to kiss him."
"He gasped lightly and his eyes rolled back, "oh my gosh!~ right there!~" he quivered and bit at the sheets."
"He smiled and nodded, "I love your last name it's so cute! Why don't you say it often?""
"He squeaked lightly and his moan got louder, "Carlos!~ you're so deep!~" he clutched the sheets."
"He nodded and smiled brightly, "how about Cecil Palmer Martinez?" He whispered and smiled."
"He moaned and panted spreading his legs wider. "I love you~" he whispered. Clutching them tightly and quivering, "oh god Carlos!~""
"He smiled and nuzzled his chest, "Martinez~ I like that baby~" he whispered and smiled."
""Three children." He mumbled and nodded, gripping the sheets gently. He arching his back so Carlos could go as deep as possible."
""Well I love you." He smiled and gazed up at him, such a loving look in all three of his eyes."
"He grinned brightly, "do you realize how much I love you and your surname?""
""I did give birth to two children and I haven't had sex since~ it's been about a year now~""
""Tell me your last name baby!~" he gave a cute puppy dog face."
"He moaned into the sheets to stifle their noises and his back arched almost immediately."
""I never did get your last name." He smiled and nuzzled Carlos's chest."
"He blushed and smirked, "then why don't you just fuck me in your lab coat my big handsome rebel~""
""No juniors big guy, north, south, and.. Hmm... Dustin." He smiled cutely."
"- condom and threw it to Carlos. "This is a little more glamorous than fucking over a desk in your lab~""
"He nodded, "condom it is." He whispered and hopped onto the bed, crawling over to the drawer with his ass in full view. He pulled out a-"
""Most definitely but maybe don't translate it just have him be South." He laughed lightly and rested his head on Carlos's shoulder."
"He moaned lightly, "depends if you want to get me pregnant again." He whispered and started to unbutton Carlos's flannel."
""It means the north wind." He smiled lightly and kissed the child's forehead, "it's a beautiful name.""
"He nodded and walked upstairs with Carlos, holding his hand gently and squeezing every once in a while."
"He blushed and smiled before looking down to the child, "amatus." He whispered."
"His cheeks reddened and he nodded, nuzzling his neck gently. "Would that be alright with you faceless old woman?" He waited for a soft yes."
""I love you more!""
"His cheeks got redder if possible and he nuzzled the new born as if to hide."
"- born.. I just accidentally blinded myself with lust.""
"He buried his face in his shoulder and sniffled, "I must've missed the teeth.. I guess I've had pent up hormones since the babies were -"
"He rolled his eyes and smiled, "my big shmoopy puppy dog~ I'm sure the faceless old woman will be happy to see the children."
""He has Kevin though.." He sighed shakily and whispered with a whimper, "I thought it was you...""
"His cheeks reddened deeply and he mumbled, "you're such a handsome dork.""
""I-I'm just confused as to why your double tried to mate with me.. I mean he has everything. He was the CEO of StrexCorp!""
"He held the children close and softly said, "usually the prophecy stones predict the names but I filed for original names when I give birth."
"He was pacing and rubbing a shark toothed bitemark on his neck. The children were nibbling at some soft crackers as they watched."
""They're fraternal twins." He blushed deeply and reached for the child in Carlos's arms lightly, "I love you.""
"- brown hair."
"He stayed downstairs to make sure their sons were okay. Gently stroking their hair and humming softly. One had white hair and the other had-"
""I can dry swallow it..." He whispered and took the meds before looking at the children. "Triplets...""
"He quickly slipped them on, he was hyperventilating as he rushedly said, "Diego, bedroom, HERE!""
"He nodded and gripped his labcoat gently. "I feel like I was ripped in two..""
"He nearly had a panic attack as he grabbed one of Carlos's lab coats and wrapped it around himself. Rushing out of the room. "Carlos!!!""
"He cried into Carlos's shoulder for a time and curled up to him."
""Yes~ my big mou- *gasp* Diego?! What the fuck?!?!" He scurried off the bed, recognizing Carlos's double. @nv_science pic.twitter.com/a9DEtgrhDl"
"He suddenly sprung up, trembling and crying, his third eye opening wide and crying as well."
"Cecils birthmarks started to thrash on his skin as his dreams turned to nightmares. A frown forming on his face as he started to squirm."
"".. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- --- ..- .-.-.- .-.-.- .-.-.-" he tapped back subconsciously."
"Even if he was asleep his fingers tapped out the same thing over and over again, " -.-. .- .-. .-.. --- ... ""
"(That's so cute! I almost don't want to respond just to see what'll be said next!)"
"Cecil subconsciously curled towards Carlos's chest, feeling warm in his husbands arms."
"Cecil's birthmarks looked dull and were weakly squirming. Cecil himself was barely moving and pale."
"He managed to get the last child out before passing out with exhaustion. His entire body trembling hard."
"The child came out but soon a surprise arose, there was one more child left. He was weak at this point, "I didn't know it was triplets.""
"(I hope it gets better) Cecil was trembling and sobbing, "Carlos.""
"He pushed harder and yelled out as he first child came out, he started to push for the second one when his grip got looser,"
""CARLOS!!!" He screamed and the shoulders came out. He was trembling and sobbing from the pain, "IT HURTS!!" He did his breathing."
""It hurts!""
"@NVInternTaylor "WHERES TAYLOR?!" He cried and clutched Carlos's hand. "IT HURTS!" The head started to crown."
""BUT YOURE NOT A DOCTOR!" He yelled and screamed as he pushed, trembling like a leaf. "IT HURTS! AGGGH!" He screamed."
"@NVInternTaylor --. . - / - .- -.-- .-.. --- .-. / .. -- / .. -. / .-.. .- -... --- .-."

"@nv_science "I can't say this wouldn't happen." He looked ashamed. pic.twitter.com/pwDsuolARH"
""Thank you Taylor." He whispered softly and hugged her."
"He blushed deeply and softly said, "I don't want to name them without him.""
"He sighed, "you're so gross." He got up and turned to go somewhere else."
"He sighed and ran his fingers over his inflated belly, "we haven't figured out names yet.""
"He blushed and cuddled up on him gently, "your eyes are gorgeous.""
"He nodded shakily and sighed, "tell him he'd better be back before our twins are born.""
""Where's my husband Taylor." Cecil sniffled."
"He blushed and smiled, "purple eyes are common heh~""
""Because it's handsome and you're my big smart scientist husband with your big adorable brown eyes.""
"He sighed and leaned to his neck. Nuzzling and taking in his cologne, "I love you.""
""Hopefully it'll have your beautiful skin tone and big brown eyes." He smiled and kissed his neck gently and lovingly."

"He blushed and smiled, cuddling against him and rubbing his belly, "I'm so lucky.""
"He leaned into carloss chest gently. "Mountains are fake.""
"He nodded with a grin and kissed him, "my handsome husband.""
"He smiled and cuddled him lightly, nuzzling him gently."
"He humphed, starting to turn away. His birthmarks squirming angrily."
""I'm pregnant!" He grinned cutely."
"He grinned and hugged him tight, "I never thought I'd be married.""
"He growled and huffed, crossing his arms and pouting like a child."
"He smiled brightly and kissed him, "guess what?""
""It's so beautiful." He whispered and kissed him."
"He kissed all over his face, stroking his hair, "I love you so so so so so much!~""
""I was made to meet you my love.""
"He smiled and relaxed, hugging her gently, "thank you Taylor." He whispered and smiled, "if you're happy I'm happy.""

"But i know even if i them higher up love my ass just thau ant going to give me shit if i fail now and the pain b4 death part is put in place"
"You down the better as if they can hurt your ego enoph and give back the top dogs thete shit they could firends above yo so they think."
"Okau no you dident have to look you got my hint about breaking the game but you did tell you earped it. As any bit they could put you"
"As they amited that looked back in time in mind and know your plan for out sbout diffrence between cheating and if theres not one way out."
"On top bye far or questionable as you would say. Now you no only explain the trap and how you cheated and everone can emit i am amazing"
"I know more than death and generaly evil but i know you belive so much is luck that fearsless but even with my last death i still cameout"
"Logic that if there's not truly one way out then its not a game. I relize this on my way and know what is planed for me specific but i know"
"And it i would say evil but you knee there is no way to scape it. You finaly think you got me but i already felt you feel my through and"
"No mater what as i have said b4 no rules. But you know you dont play fair and love it. I know whats coming up. I know exactly what is coming"
"Even though i stoped time first that you know that if time is ever stopped i will now but my ego is fucking huge so you know"
"Make everybody think i a idiot and killing my self. Know you know no matter what i would never accuse you of cheating."
"That have never been done b4 i got more respect than anyone b4. I truly own everything."
"Well i wouldent say im a perfectionest when it come to worl anymore. I know i could have i can break the rules becuse i not only do things."
"Whatever i was always a perfectionist but i neber had a complicated job so thay was easy to uphold. What i been doing now with this work"

"I never tealy depreced or i guss truly a loner just like 9th grade"
"To do but in a short period of time i went from that umcommon oxymoron loner who always wanted to be more social as i was still young"
"With no onyentions on earping time. I know nothing helped me cheat but a force thats never been done b4. I dident know what i was going"
"But none b4 we anywhere as fucking briliant than me. I knew you cheated you knew i legit did what you did but the respected way and truly."
"But what makes me the best ever is making predictions based on feelings and body language. Thete have been a very few othet loke me b4"
"Constioness"
"I got the ultimate time of all not becuse creating from one god meaning creating just intelegents and then using you should no what created"
"Soon i after i did it i noticed you watching me and could tell you quickly learned the truth well mot to quick as i had to of hacked it"
"Everyone thought it was imposible you all wete firends with god but you knew you needed 2 god and that it was always thought."
"God is supose to only wake up once. What i did was basically kill god make cause him to forget as you all had to make sence becuse"
"I know what god is. And yes god is once. My god is the purest. My god is are god which i put to sleep then woke up"
"As they could not see it posible to fix this. That they all knew there was a higher power. But everything had to have a reason."
"I became creator becuse i created and understood why we could not feel anything from the reality just like this. And everyone thought"
"So when the two girls and ya i know i said three did it but the other i will have to come back to me of course."
"Tomarow"
"Even tho time stoped which was veru difficalt and the mesagrs left explaining how to stop time. That what is imposible now could be possible"
"Or disproved in future"
"Forever logic gave god the only imposible. So logic started as a fact they could not be proven or disproved. But it could posibly be proved"
"Way ot was. That is how that work truly came to be. After time passed it was acepted that the work logic thas thankful y true time eas gone"
"To there logic and other just stoped as they kmrw it fit. They would be insualriong th selfs if they had to explain why everything was the"
"With there logic but as othets who created the same logic and just as many details if not more. But the two always expisned the decitions"
"Found that the two girls created the same story wich others created but they explained to themselves why every decition worked"
"It all better tham they could uave imagined. I was only thought that one could do it. They tree never knew each other but some research"
"For a frw hours after creating eternity so not only did they get extra emotions from the pure undeniable respect they had a secret that made"
"That everythong shoild always go and they telized after they fnished giving everytging working geomtry wich stoped time but they only stoped"
"Logic was applied as soon as you finished as the few who made it work relized the respect and emotions that all would want to give"
"You were the heros who put science to everything which no one thoight ass the beggoning had to be impossible."
"You relized this balace amd understood it was because and knew what one major tetated decition you made mafe it"
"This was a thing you been going through slowing your death which came from your own stupidity. You created the balace which was to end all"

"Que s'assabentin a Europa."
"Imagino que debe ser difÃ­cil y peligroso recordar a esta gente quÃ© debe prevalecer i quÃ© no. Ãnimos."
"Inventor de causas, urdidor de delitos, mago de la verdad, hipnotizador de juezas, falsificador profesional."
"A part de vexar-los volen provocar-nos"
"Hi ha molts catalans a l'exterior. Comencem a treballar."
"Ãs que aixÃ² de la Europa dels estats no funciona. Hem de convÃ¨ncer les persones i desprÃ©s el ajuntaments i les regions europees."
"El maltracte als consellers: emmanillats a l'esquena, l'himne d'Espanya i despullats http://www. elnacional.cat/ca/politica/ma ltracte-consellers-emmanillats-himne-espanya-despullats_209217_102.html â¦"
"Per quÃ¨ Iglesias? Per quÃ¨ li fa fÃ stic la dictadura? Per quÃ¨ enten que pensar en independÃ¨ncia no Ã©s pensar en SatanÃ s? Per quÃ¨?"
"Per quÃ¨ Felipe, per quÃ¨ no es pot pensar diferent"
"Carai, carai"
"Hauries de veure que nomÃ©s entomem les hÃ²sties. El que que no Ã©s de rebut Ã©s que pensar diferent Ã©s castigui. PerÃ² tu tambÃ© patirÃ s la dicta"
"Dona una sola denÃºncia. No facis demagogia."
"La gente denunciava a los judios creyendo que al cumplir la ley hacian bien."
"Ir poniendo las barbas a remojar."
"No siguis beneÃ¯t, la llei no regula la moral. Obeir la llei i no la consciÃ¨ncia condueix als camps de concentraciÃ³."
"AlgÃº me'ls pot engargolar"
"Elpidio i perquÃ¨ no ho denuncieu?Visaltres sabeu com? Digueu-nos que necessiteu. AcciÃ³ ja."
"Ho podeu expmicar millor?"
"Ãs que si vaig a votar, m'invaliden, si no voto, em mengen, no puc ser violent, perÃ² haig d'estar disposat a que em embafin a hÃ²sties."
"No"
"Estic molt emprenyat. Fart que em prenguin el pÃ¨l. SÃ³n dictadors i fan dictadura. Pensen que ara volem autonomia, que si ens ho donen, callo"
"Pocavergonya."
"Aquesta senyora Ã©s una immoral. QuÃ¨ tal si enviem periodistes a cada del seus familiars? Ho fem? Estic molt emprenyat. Cal que comencem?"
"Ja fan trampes, a cara descoberta. PerquÃ¨ empresonar opositors, quÃ¨ Ã©s? Dir que si guanya el independentisme, tornan aplicar el 155 quÃ¨ Ã©s?"
"No estÃ  la cosa per hÃ²sties."
"Estic momt emprenyat."
"Dimiteix,"
"Lamentable. Esteu treinent les urpes. BÃ©, no ens hi quedarem plegats de braÃ§os."
"Ja era hora."
"AixÃ² Ã©s com preguntar si l'aigua mulla."
"No el defensem. PerÃ² Ã©s massa beneÃ¯t per si sol. El veritable feixisme Ã©s molt mÃ©s fosc, viu amagat i Ã©s molt perillÃ³s. Ell nomÃ©s Ã©s tÃ²til"
"Recorda Navarro: obeir la llei i no la consciÃ¨ncia porta als camps de concentraciÃ³."
"Aplicat el conte. Quan el PP i Cs t'aplaudeixen voldrÃ  dir el mateix. Promulgar una llei tÃ© aquestes coses."
"Ja, ja, ja veig que estÃ s molt posada. Potser hauries de passar per l'Ã²ptica democrÃ tica a que et facin una revisiÃ³ dels vidres."
"De la mateixa manera que si haguÃ¨s estat demÃ²crata haguÃ©s permÃ©s un referÃ¨ndum i no hauria atonyinat al poble ni empresonst polÃ­tics. Va!"
"No oblidem, no perdonem!"
"Bona feina, Txell."
"Quina barbaritat! Qui em molesta directament l'elimino. Pur pensament feixista"
"AixÃ² passa molt. Ens entestem a dir el que ja saben. Ara cal pensar en el que no poden imaginar. La RepÃºblica Catalana."
"No de moment me'n vaig a Brusseles"
"Ja era hora. Ballart, el que has fet avui t'honora."
"Farem, farem."
"No ho oblidarem. Heu instaurat una dictadura. No us ho permetem. Sou indignes."
"Insisteixo: Per ser catalÃ  no ni ha prou en viure i treballar a Catalunya, s'ha de voler ser-ho. Per ser demÃ²crata, tambÃ©."
"Ãvole, no t'enganyis, has contribuÃ¯t als empresonaments i has facilitat el pensament Ãºnic. No pensaves que la democrÃ cia et cauria de la ma"
"Espavileu. Convoqueu-nos."
"Assamblea, comenceu a liderar accions estrÃ tegiques i tÃ ctiques de paÃ­s. Accions per restablir el llegitim govern de la RepÃºblics Catalana."
"D'aixÃ², n'estic segur. Afegiria si de cas, que la mateixa Europa dels estats pugui prosperar. La democrÃ cia s'ha de repensar."
"AixÃ² Ã©s el mÃ­nim"
"Rajoy, els feixistes t'utilitzen i tu els fas cas. SÃ© que tu no ets prou llest per dur-ho a terme solet. PerÃ² ets un cÃ²mplice."
"Comencem a contraatacar"
"Quina vergonya"
"Mas que pequeÃ±o, diria que mezquino y tirano."
"Per si soles, les manifestacions sÃ³n importants perÃ² no suficients. CaldrÃ  accions legals i pacÃ­fiques."
"GrÃ cies per la teva resposta, perÃ² jo sÃ³c poble i no sÃ© que fer per restaurar el legitim govern de Catalunya i retornar la democrÃ cia."
"Les manifestacions estan bÃ©, PerÃ² cal actuar, cal organitzar mes accions legals i pacÃ­fiques per restituir el nostre govern."
"Voleu organitzar la societat catalana d'una vegada. Voleu posar-vos les piles d'una vegada"
"Mireu, us ho dic en catalÃ  perquÃ¨ ja m'entendreu prou. Sou responsables de la dictadura que es viu a Catalunya i a Espanya. Sou resplnsables"
"Doncs, espavila."
"Doncs, quÃ­ pren el lideratge?"
"CaldrÃ  que ens organitzem. Hem de comenÃ§ar a actuar."
"Irganitzem-nos."
"Ãvole, per ser catalÃ , no ni ha prou en viure i treballar a Catalunya, a mÃ©s s'ha de voler ser-ho. Per ser demÃ²crata, tambÃ©."
"Miquel ets cÃ²mplice. Ho saps oi? Has atentat contra la democrÃ cia."
"Ãs que sÃ³n tan imbÃ¨cils que creuen que si els separen deixaran creure en els seus valors."
"Calma"
"AlgÃº ha de dirigir al poble. Organitzem-nos."
"AixÃ² no Ã©s prevaricaciÃ³. AixÃ² Ã©s dictadura feixista."
"Jordi, tu has contribuÃ¯t en aquesta bogeria. Potser no ho creus, perÃ² aixÃ­. Era extremista que els independentistes volguessin democrÃ cia?"
"Si mÃ©s no, estÃ  clar que hi ha malfactors titulars"
"Ãs vergonyÃ³s."
"Llibertat d'expressiÃ³!!!!!!, si senyor. AquÃ­ no es pot ni partar."
"Vull pensar que no s'atreviran. PerÃ² nomÃ©s Ã©s el meu pensar."

"Scott Brooks ha confirmado que maÃ±ana Markieff Morris jugarÃ¡ de inicio contra los Cavs. Se espera que juegue 15-16 minutos. #DCFamily"
"TambiÃ©n se ha anunciado que Devin Robinson ha sido asignado en la G-League (tiene contrato two-way) por lo que ahora tenemos 13 disponibles"
"Los Wizards han anunciado que renuncian a Carrick Felix. Ahora mismo queda un espacio libre en el roster. #DCFamily"
"Dura derrota anoche contra los Suns por 116-122. Fue nuestra vuelta a casa, al Capital One Arenaâ¦ https://www. instagram.com/p/BbAH2XzAZbw/"

"Tenemos 15 partidos durante noviembre. Â¿Cual crees que serÃ¡ nuestro balance este mes? #DCFamily @WashWizards @HoopDistrictDC @WizardsFrance"
"Tenemos una semana clase con partidos importantes, los prÃ³ximos Cavs y Raptors, luego recibimos a Mavs y Lakers"
"Aun con todas las crÃ­ticas (necesarias y justificadas), la temporada acaba de empezar. Hay que trabajar para seguir mejorando"
"AsÃ­ estÃ¡n las cosas en la Conferencia. 4-3 a 1,5 del 1Âº #DCFamily pic.twitter.com/3LssNpzDFZ"
"Esta semana nos quedan dos partidos y no son cualquier cosa. Viernes: Cavs (en DC) Domingo: Raptors (en Toronto) #DCFamily"
"EstÃ¡ claro que no siempre se puede estar al 100%, pero cuando terminas el 1er cuarto con +17, ese partido hay que ganarlo"
"Y ese planteamiento si ves el partido se nota y lo Ãºnico que se consigue es lo que ha pasado, perder partidos que deberÃ­an ganarse"
"Los preparamos como âun partido para Bealâ, o âun partido para Wallâ. Y es un error. Ayer Beal 40 pts, pero para que?"
"Hay algo que creo que es un error en el planteamiento de los partidos. Desde hace un tiempo estos partidos fÃ¡ciles, los preparamos como..."
"Guarda este tweet y a final de temporada lo comparamos"
"Preparamos los partidos de esta semana como si el partido de ayer ya estuviese ganado y esto es lo que pasa. Exceso de confianza"
"En las declaraciones tras el partido, Mike Scott calificÃ³ la derrota como inaceptable. No lo ha podido decir mÃ¡s claro. #DCFamily"
"Duele porque son equipos con los que tienes que contar la victoria como segura, pero hay que jugar"
"Pero los Cavs en cualquier momento despiertan y eso puede ser el viernes. No les hace falta exhibirse ahora"
"Pero no se puede terminar un partido en el 1er cuarto"
"Despues de esto queda reflexionar. Hay MUCHAS cosas que mejorar. El viernes recibimos a los Cavs, otra prueba de fuero"
"Y ya hemos perdido contra Lakers y Suns. Y todo por confiarnos, por creer que los partidos se ganan antes de jugar, o jugando 12 minutos"
"Estas derrotas son las que duelen. Con todos los respetos a los Suns, pero si queremos estar arriba hay que ganar estos partidos"
"Hay poco positivo que se pueda salvar hoy. Aunque si hay que destacar algo es la actitud de @mikescott , lo ha dado todo. Deben tomar ejemplo"
"Hemos recibido 107 puntos en los Ãºltimos 3 cuartos. AquÃ­ hay defensa? Eso es VERGONZOSO. Se puede perder, pero no de esa manera"
"Es dificil de explicar como despues de un 1er cuarto con 32-15 y alcanzando diferencias de 20 pts, luego se pierde de esta manera"
"RidÃ­culo y vergonzosa derrota hoy contra los Suns. Enhorabuena para ellos que han jugado durante 4 cuartos. Nosotros sÃ³lo jugamos uno"
"No es solo una cuestiÃ³n de cerrar partidos. No se puede jugar solo el primer cuarto. Los partidos duran 4 cuartos"
"Final. Wizards 116-122 Suns Beal 40 pts, 5 reb Wall 21 pts, 5 reb, 6 as Scott 12 pts, 8 reb #DCFamily"
"RidÃ­culo partido y ridÃ­culos Ãºltimos ataques"
"Y en teorÃ­a este era el partido âfacilâ de la semana. Pues vamos a agarrarnos fuerte"
"1 minuto para el final, +6 para los Suns"
"39 puntos TJ Warren. Mmmm"
"Vaya partido..."
"Lo peor es ver en cada partido a jugadores de los banquillos saltar a la pista por jugadas espectaculares y acordarse de la sanciÃ³n a Morris"
"Oubre for threeeee"
"Nosotros estamos haciendo el ridÃ­culo, pero el esperpento arbitral creo que estÃ¡ siendo hasta peor"
"Que han pitado????"
"Lo que estamos viendo en estos 3 Ãºltimos cuartos roza el ridÃ­culo..."
"El parcial en lo que llevamos de segunda parte es de 30-47. Tremendo"
"La masacre continua. +5 para los Suns"
"Los Suns por delante en el marcador por primera vez en el partido. 90-92"
"Teniendo en cuenta que el 1er cuarto ha terminado 32-15..."
"O solucionamos esto en el ultimo cuarto o la victoria se va para Phoenix"
"La realidad es que entre el 2Âº y 3er cuarto hemos recibido 72 puntos. Eso es INADMISIBLE"
"Final del 3er cuarto. Wizards 90-87 Suns Beal 30 pts Wall 17 pts Scott 12 pts #DCFamily"
"Dos minutos para final del 3er cuarto, 84-81"
"Uff vaya defensa...cada jugada anotan"
"Wall for threee"
"Vaya desastre de 3er cuarto...que termine pronto"
"Por menos de los que acaba de hacer Mike James antes le han pitado tÃ©cnica a John Wall... ahora no"
"Lo de la defensa hay que mirarlo seriamente. Estamos recibiendo 20 puntos en 6 minutos..."
"Ahora mismo esto parece una pachanga. Nos estamos dejando llevar por el ritmo que ellos quieren... 75-73"
"3Âª falta de Kelly Oubre. Hoy no estÃ¡ teniendo su dÃ­a"
"En el 2Âº cuarto hemos recibido 37 puntos. Ahora llevamos ya 11 en 3 minutos. La defensa brilla por su ausencia"
"Parece que aun no hemos salido del vestuario en la segunda parte..."
"Lo mejor hasta el descanso es el gran nivel que estÃ¡n mostrando desde el banquillo. Beal y Scott muy bien"
"Si, desde hace ya varios aÃ±os. Si el banquillo sigue en esta progresiÃ³n puede ser un gran plus"
"Descanso. Wizards 64-52 Suns Beal 19 pts Scott 12 pts, 7 reb Wall 8 pts, 4 as #DCFamily"
"Com tanta falta, Wall 2, Beal 2, Oubre 2, Smith 3"
"Y a todo esto, los Suns se ponen a 12"
"Vaya concierto de silbato estÃ¡n dando ahora..."
"Block by Wall!!"
"Ahora mismo, Titulares 28 pts Banquillo 26 pts Asi si!"
"Al final, poco a poco y sin hacer ruido los Suns se estaban acercando"
"Beal for threee"
"@NBCSWizards From Spain , following our Wizards! pic.twitter.com/XQ0VFgWJEl"
"Vaya falta de Len a Smith, sin sentido, le ha podido hacer mucho daÃ±o. Obviamente es flagrante"
"Tiempo muerto. 45-30 a 6 minutos del descanso"
"Del rebote en defensa a la canasta en apenas 2 segundos! Gran contraataque"
"MVP @mikescott !!!"
"Final del 1er cuarto. Wizards 32-15 Suns Beal 11 pts Scott 7 pts, 3 reb Wall 4 pts, 3 as #DCFamily #WizSuns"

"Gran movimiento al poste de Sato, ahi puede sacar ventaja"
"Problemas tambien de faltas para Smith (2)"
"Scott for threee"
"Beal for threeee"
"Problemas de faltas para Kelly Oubre. Ya lleva 2. Tiene que entrar Satoransky"

"De esta forma estarÃ­a 100% disponible para el partido del viernes contra los Cavs. HabrÃ¡ que ir recuperÃ¡ndole poco a poco, no hizo preseason"
"Como comentÃ¡bamos ayer, Markieff Morris podrÃ­a estar ya listo para volver. Hoy podrÃ­a cumplir su suspensiÃ³n vs Suns #DCFamily #WizSuns"

"This is why it was a very bad idea to provide them. Can't stress enough how much a DB projection is of no value."
"Such as?"
"it's often based on an average of, say, last 3 years salary isn't it so "final salary" generates queries anyway!"
"Have there been concerns raised from BSPS members after receiving the quotes?"

"DB projections at 55, 60 & 65 are useless. No idea why the Trustees would agree to issue those."
"Defined relates to calculation of benefit, as per scheme Rules. Not to what pension might be in 20 years time?"
"Defined: FPS x PS / Accrual rate. DC: who knows. Not identical at all!"
"I still think defined is correct."
"At least the pension at DOL? Defined ...."
"I'm trying to agree with you here Future benefit isn't guaranteed but still defined."
"But yes, see what you mean, still a clear definition of how to calculate benefit."
"Not just tax changes, move from 3n/80ths cash to A Day limits for some, etc. Perhaps the only defined benefit is the pension at outset?"
"And capped revaluation on post05/post09 tranche. It is a clear distinction to DC, nothing "defined" about that!"
"Those could change as we saw with A Day, IR max being replaced by new formula or RPI/CPI?"
"It's the formula that makes it "defined", e.g. FPS x Service / accrual rate and so on. The expected pension at NRD isn't defined."
"It'll be worth it. Trustees haven't been compelled to deal with legacy data issues have they, so I think it's a very good thing."
"The deadline isn't here yet and the common & conditional data scores should improve for 2018 scheme returns."
"Some schemes will really struggle with it but short term pain = long term gain !!"
"Yes, we're working on it but not quite "GDPR ready" I don't think. Time and resource, as you say but the work has to be done."
"I think that's what many providers will be working on for GDPR, etc. Digging through paper files and populating missing data. Happy days"
"Agree 100%"
"I guess the only known quantity is pension at DOL. Even annual statements whilst active aren't to be relied upon in case of closure, etc."
"Ah, I see what you mean. I was thinking more of an accrued benefit as opposed to future changes in Scheme design, legislation, PPF, etc"
"Thanks, Jo. It will be a problem for the Dashboard, I've no doubt about that. Depending on what will be expected."
"Plus this includes service dates, FPS, conts, etc. None of which are essential if entitlement at DOL is recorded."
"This doesn't impact on benefit calculations. If it did, we'd never get anything out of the door!"
"It'll be interesting to see what level of detail will be expected on the Dashboard for DB!"
"Yes, true. It's the "suggestion" that data gaps result in benefits being calculated incorrectly? That's simply not the case."
"I'm guessing that TPR would be basing their comments on common and conditional data scores (which aren't up to standard for many schemes)."
"Is the evidence available, Jo? You or Ros may have already tweeted details, I'd be interested in seeing it."
"I've schemes where data standards are below the required level but that doesn't impede our ability to calculate benefits correctly does it"
"That's just my personal view. This could cause widespread concern & worry when there needn't be."
"Yet another irresponsible public statement from somebody who should know better."
"Can't comment without details."
"I don't understand why such a comment would even be made. Clearly focussed on legacy data gaps & confusing the issue."
"IT?"
"No, that isn't covered under disclosure regs. Calculations are often manual, lengthy and would be too complex for a layman to understand."
"We're talking about two diff things: missing legacy data and absence of details of entitlement. Former is common, latter is rare."
"This scenario would never happen, especially if member has evidence of scheme entitlement."
"If you know your entitlement then a copy would be sent to the admin provider as evidence. Problem solved?"
"If the expectation is for DB members to be able to view complete records for all legacy DB schemes on Dashboard, it will be disappointing."
"Yes, don't always have a hard copy record but electronic data will show what's needed to calculate retirement benefits. Even if gaps."
"It will be nigh on impossible for DB providers to feed complete member records for the whole scheme membership onto the Dashboard."
"Trustees can only work with data they hold but it's rare that the DB pension at DOL is missing, which is the starting point."
"Agree, there's usually a workaround."
"Member booklets are often out of date and superseded by scheme rule changes."
"*Most* DB data common and conditional data scores are well below the minimum. 2% is very, very low (in my experience)."
"All of which will be looked at under GDPR but not sure how much missing data will be recovered."
"That was meant for Al, sorry"
"I'll have a peek. It is an issue but there are ways around it, it wouldn't stop a benefit being put into payment."
"On DB? You'd be surprised: service dates, salary history, COEs, contributions. Pensioner historical records sometimes worse."
"2. So the "defined benefit" at DOL will be there, perhaps not possible to reconstruct with data gaps. Otherwise, it's a judgement call."
"1. Ah, so this is more to do with legacy data. Yes, it can be an issue but usually have pension at DOL even if gaps in salary history, etc."
"How can a defined benefit change?"
"Me neither. Scheme design might be complex but benefits clearly laid out in Rules."
"I've not had one enquiry about the PAA, it's not really "out there" in public domain is it."
"Could be if they have AVC policy?"
"Most will have access to the Â£500 PAA. Surely should use this then Gov't and industry will "top up"?"

"Sometimes, usually the receiving scheme. All dealt with within statutory timescale though."

"I doubt it would make a difference if they've already seen Â£20,000 lump sum figure, signed and returned all docs?"
"Info from provider should state VERY clearly that it's taxed."
"If set guidance, scheme rules allow and members are charged for multiple CETV quotes and/or extra work, I don't have a problem with them!"
"I don't like PW info being hidden in packs. A standalone leaflet *might* be more effective."
"Yep, not enough."
"That's why admin providers need to be looking at including this info with regular mailings I think? Instead of following CETV request, etc."
"But most people don't which is why one leaflet hidden in a pack isn't enough."
"I read everything. All the small print"
"Last provider I worked for, CETV pack was 35 pages long .."
"Not if it's the only one the member ever receives!"
"I can handle tough when there's proper guidance. There isn't any so no point offering it as an option."

"I started following you because you seem to be one of the few who does, why is it like you're always fighting uphill battles?"
"You're soaking in it! We all are, all the time. Because humans, even scientists, don't think scientifically. This is your struggle!"
"Ah. The myth of the fence sitter. It might just be possible that people that study scicomm have thought of that. And no. It's tribal war."
"This is an ideological war in itself, faith in debate. The data, the science of scicomm, does not support it's efficacy as intervention."
"Debate doesn't change minds, nor does education, nor does information. It signals your tribe. The problem is more complex than "just facts""
"The reaction is denialism, every time. It's wonderful to be idealistic about ideas and debate, but we can't fool ourselves."
"Tell someone the basis of their job is flawed, ask them to accept an idea that invalidates their choices in life. It happens. It fails."
