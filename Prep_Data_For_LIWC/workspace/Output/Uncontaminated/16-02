"@MeganizerATC Elena was so annoying she was the main character and she pissed me off like 99% of the time XD"
"@amellackles me too but at least we have the books :3"
"@amellackles haha we should have picked the damn actors ourselves XD"
"@MeganizerATC eh I just don't know how you can motivate yourself to watch it I just think of 40 mins of tvd and I'm bored already"
"@MeganizerATC I saw you saying how boring tvd was now it definitely should have called it a day at s6"

"@amellackles to him for help xD"
"@amellackles such a shame cos the books are amazing & they're not following Magnus very well he gets so annoyed when they keep coming"
"@amellackles idk cos if Luke said he died... she isn't gonna think Jace is her brother now? She will think he's dead?"
"@amellackles Luke told Clary about her brother dying in a fire so it doesn't look like they're gonna do it now? :/"
"@amellackles do you think shadowhunters will do the brother/sister storyline with Jace and Clary? Doesn't look like they will now??"
"@amellackles you should check :)"
"@amellackles do the cheap books you can get for a penny on amazon not deliver to you??"

"@MeganizerATC @ProudFangGirl @heartyhamna WOWZA!!"
"@MeganizerATC @ProudFangGirl @heartyhamna sorry Batbin never got a notification for this?? :/ I'm seeing it tomorrow :3"
"@amellackles I don't like the effect they use when they're running? It looks weird"
"@amellackles they concentrated more on doing stupid flips than actual fighting"
"@amellackles haha Alec's smile though was so cute they are adorable"
"@amellackles and yeh the fighting was terrible"
"@amellackles I guess and I didn't like it cos they all looked really weird they could have been better flashbacks"
"@amellackles I just thought they were so pointless and not really needed xD"
"@amellackles Maryse's acting is so wooden"
"@amellackles didn't like the flashbacks thought the episode was a bit all over the place tbh xD"
"@amellackles a bit shit but Alec and Magnus were so damn cute"

"@amellackles she was terrible in the scorch trials and she was only in it for like 2 mins"
"@amellackles damn that is an annoying ending I honestly thought my link cut it off early!!"
"@amellackles maybe she just needs to find a role she is good at cos she defo ain't good at playing clary xD"
"@amellackles I was checking how ep 7 ended before I started ep 8"

"@amellackles the music then it cut off just before the tower hit the ground"
"@amellackles it ended with Maggie seeing the green balloons then the tower started falling and then Rick was shouting but he was mute bc of"
"@amellackles I just think the books are too good to be made into a successful adaptation"
"@amellackles it cut off the ep with the tower mid-fall just checking that's how it ended? Or if it still had a few more mins?"
"@amellackles It wil be a miracle if they renew it for s2 tbh XD"
"@amellackles that must have been damn annoying xD"
"@amellackles improving??"

"@amellackles my other friend said that too is it to clearly show which is past and which is present? I don't get it xD"
"@amellackles yeh! 30 mins in the black and white flashbacks are pretty weird xD"
"@amellackles I'm actually watching the first ep now!"
"@amellackles I can't wait to watch it though so we can talk about it properly XD"
"@amellackles so shocked didn't think they would do that XD"
"@amellackles I know what happened s"

"@amellackles true :)"
"@amellackles ooh I saw someone who did book reviews on tumblr :)"
"@amellackles haha it better!"
"@amellackles we should definitely stick to it over summer that's a good few months! Btw I'm going to go bed now night! :)"
"@amellackles have a look at other blogs too it really helps :D"
"@amellackles omg yes"
"@amellackles same :3"
"@amellackles haha exactly"
"@amellackles yeh :D"
"@amellackles plus if it's something I enjoy doing then it won't really matter if it's popular or not cos I'm doing it for myself XD"
"@amellackles good point if we stay dedicated and post 2 or 3 reviews a month I don't see why we can't get viewers :)"
"@amellackles we can motivate each other and ask for advice if we get stuck :D"
"@amellackles me too! I think I will see how it goes over summer and then decide if it's worth carrying on and if I want to as well xD"
"@amellackles same I'm like don't lie to me!"
"@amellackles definitely :D"
"@amellackles I hate my writing which sounds weird since all I do is write essays"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles go for it! I would definitely read it"
"@amellackles maybe when we have both settled into our blogs we can give each other a book to read and review :)"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles are you gonna start doing book reviews?"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles that actually pains me"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles -__________-"
"@amellackles yeh I would edit it so many times until I thought it was okayish"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles what did they write about?? Surely they didn't know the whole story?"
"@amellackles maybe we should try doing that in the summer it would be so fun :D"
"@amellackles agreed! We will buy the book and at least try to read it :P"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles bastards"
"@amellackles we really should!"
"@amellackles yeh gives you time to disgest it before you write about it"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles wow really?? How can anyone do that"
"@amellackles we NEED to do that"
"@amellackles omg yes we should totally do that"
"@MeganizerATC @amellackles I think reading a book in one day then reviewing it is not very reliable anyway xD"
"@amellackles perfect thanks!"
"@amellackles if we start blogging now we might get one for her 2018 or 2020 shadowhunter books XD"
"@amellackles someone I knew who is a book blogger gave themselves a month to read the book so that's pretty reassuring xD"
"@amellackles we could do a review on the same book then compare them"
"@amellackles hmm I'll have to see when I write one and if I really have to talk spoilers I will put a warning :D"
"@amellackles *their D:"
"@amellackles what's there page? I can't find it :("
"@amellackles me neither I think you have to be really dedicated maybe have it for a year before you start getting stuff like that xD"
"@amellackles *at"
"@amellackles hahaha I will probs be winging it st the start"
"@amellackles I probs wouldn't go into spoilers tbh xD"
"@amellackles oh really? Poop :( how do you get it again? Through fb?"

"@amellackles She is suh a bitch though xD"
"@amellackles Tommy once -__-"
"@amellackles Newt was a bit of a dick in this film didn't like that he normally sides with Thomas on everything & I only heard him say"

"@amellackles I remember how it ends and that's it"
"@amellackles I need to re-read the last one before the film cos I don't really remember it :/"
"@amellackles haha I know how much you adore me before you :P"
"@amellackles a bitch"
"@amellackles my brother hasn't read the books but he watched the films and first thing he said to me after scorch trials was Teresa is"
"@amellackles but when she called wicked in the film and they were coming it was so intense I was like shit shit shit THOMAS!!!! XD"
"@amellackles then they meet up in the scorch and she's acting all weird and then I don't remember what happens after that"
"@amellackles me neither I remember she voluntarily gets her memories back and she escapes leaving Thomas behind but he escapes as well"
"@amellackles it is like a rollercoaster of emotions tbh xD"
"@amellackles 100% I need to see them brought to life"
"@amellackles yeh they got split up in the book but she still sides with wicked in the end"
"@amellackles not a lot of books can do that so these are special :p"
"@amellackles idek why I can't explain but it just gives me loads of emotions and I love when books can do that"
"@amellackles her acting is just awful ugh but I have to watch it for shadowhunters XD"
"@amellackles I know she betrays them in the book but actually seeing it in the film I was so mad I was like you bitch"
"@amellackles I am definitely going to see the last one in the cinema & TERESA IS SUCH A BITCH OMG SHE BETRAYED THEM ALL"
"@amellackles haha I remember like spamming you with it and you were just like okaaay... XD"
"@amellackles her acting omg it makes me so mad idk why"
"@amellackles I saw her and I literally turned to my mum and said please no"
"@amellackles I don't think I've loved a film adaptation this much these films are just amazing I ain't even mad about the changes"
"@amellackles even though it was a diff scene to the book it was still so creepy! They got it spot on tbh"
"@amellackles the scene in the shopping centre omg that was amazing it was terrifiying XD"
"@amellackles had a minor role"
"@amellackles omg I can't believe the one who plays tv show clary was in it I literally can't stand her acting -__- I was so happy she only"
"@amellackles he made me actually care what happened to him he brought the book character to life damn he's so talented"
"@amellackles yeh there was a lot of changes but I didn't really mind I can't get over how amazing Dylan was as Thomas xD"
"@amellackles did you see the pics on insta?"
"@amellackles amaaaaazing! The crank scenes were so intense loved it! Dylan was awesome! :D"
"@amellackles just finished The Scorch Trials :D"
"Watching The Scorch Trials finally! :3"

"@amellackles Good :D so happy you're reading again!"
"@amellackles what do you think?!"
"@amellackles hahaha it's okay xD"
"@amellackles I've never felt so betrayed by an author in my life xD I put all my trust in her for a happy ending and got a smack in the face"
"@amellackles I think it will be!"
"@amellackles me too I will literally never get over it xD"
"@amellackles I know we have so long to wait :("
"@amellackles oh god I didn't think of that D: that's so sad but so damn good"
"@amellackles It's gonna be awesome can't wait to read it!!"
"@amellackles That's what I was thinking... like make it so she doesn't die cos Ascendant is like rising??"
"@amellackles hahahahaha so true :P"
"@amellackles Good point..."
"@amellackles I wonder why they named it Ascendant though?? It doesn't make sense for the ending :("
"@amellackles Hopefully they don't fuck it up xD"
"@amellackles Instead of splitting The Death Cure I would happily have The Fever Code :D IT COMES OUT IN SEPTEMBER!!"
"@amellackles Same kinda annoyed about Divergent tbh :( The first film is always so boring what's the point? Oh yeah more money for them XD"
"@amellackles I feel like Simon will be a vampire next ep xD"
"My throat is so sore if I'm getting that cold again after just getting rid of it I'll be so pissed"
"@amellackles it would be so awesome if they made The Kill Order into a film instead XD and then The Fever Code I would be so happy"
"@amellackles split the last film"
"@amellackles I know that the films are completely different to the books but the last book wasn't that long so I don't think they would"
"@amellackles *film oops :D"
"@amellackles I don't think they are?? I just heard that The Death Cure is the last time and will be released 2017"

"@amellackles his scenes with Alec were so cute :3 Alec and Magnus are my favourites for sure"
"@amellackles it is improving though don't you think?"
"@amellackles I hope he is in it a lot more I love him as Magnus so far"
"@amellackles when Clary asks if Jace is gonna be alright and Magnus says I don't know does he normally just lay like that without moving?"
"@amellackles it was better than all the other eps imo xD"
"@amellackles I KNOW there was no need for that at all it completely ruined that scene Isn't Magnus just amazing? The actor is so good"
"@amellackles she has a really dumb moment and Magnus just takes the piss outta her he is perfect"
"@amellackles Magnus and Alec are gonna be so good together they will make this show 1000x times better xD"
"@amellackles screams and it completely killed it but then it got good again towards the end :')"
"@amellackles yeh best episode Magnus was so funny :) still hate Clary though I was really enjoying the ep until thid one point when she"
"@amellackles oh fair enough XD"
"@amellackles why?? :o"
"@amellackles you watched shadowhunters?"
"@amellackles yeh you can but what is the point? Twitter makes no sense now ugh XD"

"@amellackles Yeaaaah! s3 is awesome btw as funny as the first two seasons :D ep 6 has been the funniest so far"
"@amellackles oh good I followed you back super fast then XD"
"@amellackles I felt like they tried to cram literally everything that happens in the book into a 2hr film XD"
"@amellackles I see you added Brooklyn 99 to your bio :DDDDDD"
"@amellackles I meant to click tweet but I clicked unfollow button (laptop) they're both blue I'm sorry"
"@amellackles I just unfollowed you by accident stalking your acc"
"@amellackles I wish they were happier in the book tbh xD I just remember them always fighting"
"@amellackles didn't get a notification for this sorry :( Me too even though it frustrates me I will still re-read it about 1000x times XD"
"Get one of my essays back this week oh shit"
"@amellackles yeh it would have been soo much easier to read"
"@amellackles would have been better split into different parts xD"
"@amellackles haha it was impossible for me to adjust idk why it just confused me XD"
"@amellackles learnt so much about him :)"
"@amellackles I thought it was hard to get into not gonna lie I struggled with him in Allegiant too idk why :( it was good though cos you"
